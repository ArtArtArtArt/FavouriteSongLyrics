​(kniht flesym raeh t'nac I)
(​kniht flesym raeh t'nac I)
(—flesym raeh t'nac I)
Get right

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Tryna say I'm not, but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginnin' to realize that you put me over the edge

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should havе recognized
It's too late for choosing sidеs
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)


[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointin' every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missin' the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Bridge: Emily Armstrong]
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think


[Breakdown: Emily Armstrong]
Stop yelling at me
I can't hear myself think, yeah
Stop yelling at me, stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Outro: Emily Armstrong & Mike Shinoda]
Is that what it is?
That's what it is
Hahahahaha

[Verse 1]
There are no more tears to cry
I heard you begging for life
Running out of medicine
You're worse than you've ever been

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ah) Screaming for me, baby
(Ah-ah) Like you're gonna die
(Ah-ah) Poison on the inside
I could be your antidote tonight

(Ah-ah) Poison on the inside
I could be your antidote tonight

I could play the doctor, I can cure your disease
If you were a sinner, I could make you believe
Lay you down like one, two, three
Eyes roll back in ecstasy
I can smell your sickness, I can cure your (Cure)
Cure your disease


[Verse 2]
You're so tortured when you sleep
Plagued with all your memories
You reach out, and no one's there
Like a god without a prayer

2,Either,Tiny Habits,"7 ContributorsEither Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a party tonight, and I think that I might not be going
But I hate putting fights up with people that I love and want me there
So I call up a best friend, he's got an ex probably going
If I know him at all, then he probably won't wanna see her

[Pre-Chorus]
He says the words I wanna hear
""I don't wanna go either""

[Chorus]
Everyone's drinking and singing along
We would stand next to the speaker
You know I'm praying you'll say what I want
Tell me you don't wanna go either
Blowin' smoke, ""You got a lighter?"" ""I don't""
TV's on, but nobody's watching
Everyone's drinking and singing along
Staying at home would be cheaper
You know I'm praying you'll say what I want
Tell mе you don't wanna go either

[Verse 2]
So let's say that I havе a momentary lapse in judgment
Drink everything that I'm handed, and the chances rise
And I almost forget the lights that I left on, dog that I don't own
'Til somebody says that they're going to bed, ""Have fun at the next one""


[Pre-Chorus]
Think I wanna be her
I don't wanna go either

[Chorus]
Everyone's drinking and singing along
We would stand next to the speaker
You know I'm praying you'll say what I want
Tell me you don't wanna go either
Run and go, nobody here I know
On their phones, nobody's talking
Everyone's drinking and singing along
Staying at home would be cheaper
You know I'm praying you'll say what I want
Tell me you don't wanna go

[Bridge]
What if I miss out? (I don't wanna go)
What if I regret this? (I don't think so)
What if everybody really wants me there? (What if I don't care?)
What if I miss out? (I don't wanna go)
What if it's the one time it's actually fun, though?
What if the love of my life is there?

[Chorus]
Blowin' smoke, ""You got a lighter?"" ""I don't""
TV's on, but nobody's watching
Everyone's drinking and singing along
Staying at home would be cheaper
You know I'm praying you'll say what I want
Tell me you don't wanna go either"
3,Figure You Out,Djo,"20 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoFigure You Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm beginning to understand
There's no mystery to this man
It's the simplest things I need
Just my friend and a place to sleep
But I never fail to surprise
There's a feeling that's new to me
Unmistakably, that's my voice
And it's speaking as clear as day

[Chorus]
I've been tryin' to figure you out
I've been tryin' to figure you out
I've been tryin' to figure you out
I've been tryin' to figure you out
I've been tryin' to figure you out

[Verse 2]
Is the memory really mine?
Is the story I told just fake?
How can you get to know yourself?
Take a test and you get a grade
If the monеy just wasn't there
And the powеr you had was gone
And these people were just like you
Tell me, then, would you lend a hand?


[Chorus]
I've been tryin' to figure you out
Tell me, then, would you lend a hand?
I've been tryin' to figure you out

[Bridge]
It's not easy when you're closin' down
Down, down
Tell me, then, would you lend a hand?

[Outro]
Something's in my mind, and I'm focused on you, yeah (Ah-eh)
Something's in my mind, and I'm focused on you, yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Something's in my mind, and I'm focused on you, yeah (Ah-eh)
Something's in my mind, and I'm focused on you, yeah (Ooh-ooh)

I'd scavenge 'round

On huge slabs of meat

Water derby day
Twenty-six pumps on a Crosman
And it's time to play

7,Where You Are (feat. WILLOW),"PinkPantheress,WILLOW","2 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishPinkPantheress - Where you are (Ft. WILLOW) (Український переклад) Lyrics[Текст пісні: Де ти є (за уч. WILLOW)]

[Куплет 1: PinkPantheress]
Страждаю в тиші, все ще не знаю я чому, думаю
Я створена для іншого (Іншого)
Квітка, яку я дозрівала зав'янула сьогодні, я обираю
Покинути тебе сьогодні, ти ж не хочеш цього, чи не так? (Чи не так, чи не так, чи не так)

[Перед приспів: PinkPantheress, WILLOW]
О-о, о
Я не знаю що робити
Хотіла б щоб я ніколи тебе не зустріла, ні о
(Я добре знаю це відчуття, хотілось би щоб я могла розповісти)

[Бридж: PinkPantheress]
То рік я пройшла
Через кілька почуттів, які ти не дав мені обрати
(Ти за мною при ударив)
Тепер оглядаючись назад коли ми лаялись, це нагадує
Що я маю надію знайти когось іншого

[Приспів: PinkPantheress, WILLOW]
Тож скажи мені де ти є, є, є, є, є, є, є
Тепер моє життя котиться у низ, замінила своє розбите сер-
Буль ласка, скажи мені де ти є, є, є, є, є
Втратила розуміння що робити, не провела й дня у власній шкурі, тепер
Скажи мені де ти є, є, є, є, є (О, о, о)
Ти сказав що все буде в нормі, але я знаю що ми не будемо такими як колись (Це відчуття)
Я знаю що можу працювати з ймовірностями
Будь ласка, скажи мені те що хочеш зустрітись знов


[Куплет 2: WILLOW]
Ніколи б і не думала що захочу вискочити зі своєї голови
Ніколи б і не думала що колись засумніваюся у тому що ти казав
У моєму ліжку, у моїй кімнаті, не можу я забути
Стільки надій, стільки мрій
Ні, це не те чим воно бляха здається (Так)

[Перед приспів: PinkPantheress та WILLOW]
Я не знаю що робити
Хотіла б щоб я ніколи тебе не зустріла, ні о
Я не знаю що робити
Хотіла б щоб я ніколи тебе не зустріла, ні о

[Приспів: PinkPantheress, WILLOW]
Тож скажи мені де ти є, є, є, є, є, є, є
Тепер моє життя котиться у низ, замінила своє розбите сер-
Буль ласка, скажи мені де ти є, є, є, є, є
Втратила розуміння що робити, не провела й дня у власній шкурі, тепер
Скажи мені де ти є, є, є, є, є (О, о, о)
Ти сказав що все буде в нормі, але я знаю що ми не будемо такими як колись (Це відчуття)
Я знаю що можу працювати з ймовірностями
Будь ласка, скажи мені те що хочеш зустрітись знов"

10,John The Fisherman,Primus,"27 ContributorsJohn the Fisherman Lyrics[Intro]
One, two
(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
When he was young, you'd not find him doing well in school
His mind would turn unto the waters
Always the focus of adolescent ridicule
He has no time for farmer’s daughters
Alienated from the clique society
A lonely boy finds peace in fishing
His mother says, ""John, this is not the way life's supposed to be
Don't you see the life that you’re missing?""

[Chorus]
And he says
""When I grow up, I want to be
One of the harvesters of the sea
I think before my days are done
I want to be a fisherman""

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Now years gone by, we find a man who rules the sea
He sets out on a dark May morning
To bring his catch back to this small community
He doesn't see the danger dawning
Four hours up, oh, the ocean swelled and swelled
The fog rolled in, it started raining
The starboard bow, oh my God, we're going down
They do not hear his frantic mayday


[Chorus]
As he says
""When I grow up, I want to be
One of the harvesters of the sea
I think before my days are done
I want to be a fisherman""

[Outro]
""I'll live and die a fisherman""
Calling John the fisherman
Calling John the fisherman
We're calling John the fisherman"

Bloated, blue and cold
I've got my pride, I drink my wine
I'd drink only the finest
'Cept I haven't earned a dime in several months, or were it years?
The breath on that fat bastard could bring any man to tears
We had our words, a common spat
So I kissed him upside the cranium
With that aluminum baseball bat

[Куплет 1]
Сотні інших — ти один
І без тебе світ не дихає
Чую сигаретний дим
Нагадаю собі ним тебе
І в кінці кінців не дивно
Що людина для людини
Віддає своє єдине
Не дає собі піти
І для мене, певно, не важливо
Чи даси мені це ти

[Приспів]
Тільки не прощайся назавжди
Я не відчуваю, що готова знову
Зникнути в обіймах самоти
В тебе вдома

[Куплет 2]
Просто випадковий збіг
Змінює всі плани і збиває з ніг
Сотні напівсонних днів
Склянка повна лиш напів
Бо ти, вирішив за нас обох:
«Надто сильна не любов між нами»
Я б летіла стрімголов
Тільки щоб знов і знов
Притиснути руками


[Приспів]
Тільки не прощайся назавжди
Я не відчуваю, що готова знову
Зникнути в обіймах самоти
В тебе вдома

Et puis je l'imagine habitant mon décor
J'aurais tant à lui dire si j'avais su parler
Comment lui faire lire au fond de mes pensées ?
Mais comment font ces autres à qui tout réussi ?
Qu'on me dise mes fautes, mes chimères aussi
Moi j'offrirais mon âme, mon coeur et tout mon temps
Mais j'ai beau tout donner, tout n'est pas suffisant

S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer

Je ferais de ce monde un rêve, une éternité

J'ai du sang dans mes songes, un pétale séché
Quand des larmes me rongent que d'autres ont versées
La vie n'est pas étanche, mon île est sous le vent
Les portes laissent entrer les cris même en fermant
Dans un jardin d'enfant, sur un balcon des fleurs
Ma vie paisible où j'entends battre tous les coeurs
Quand les nuages foncent, présages des malheurs
Quelles armes répondent aux pays de nos peurs ?

S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer
Si l'on changeait les choses un peu

Je sais ces guerres, j'en n'ai pas peur
Je sais me défendre, j'ai bien appris
On n'est pas des tendres par ici

Je sais les hivers, je sais le froid
Mais la vie sans toi, je sais pas

Lutte après lutte, pire après pire
Chaque minute, j'ai cru tenir
J'voudrais apprendre jour après jour
Mais qui commande à nos amours?

Look, I'm gripping wood like a motherfucker
She ask me, can her friend ride?
Kelly wanna have a drink
And shorty wanna pop pills all night
Look, don't be fucking with my tape deck
You gon' listen to this Marvin
You gon' listen to this Bloodstone
Oh, y'all niggas want that Barry White?
Well, I don't really fuck with that right there
That could make a nigga act up right there
Well, go and get your rocks off, boo
Nah, nah, nah

I'm far from a pimp, but I'm close to you
You fucking with an old soul, twice removed

Maybe that's the reason I be {*airplane noise*} through
Now who the fuck called me a player?
I ain't one these young niggas out here sweating for a pay stub
I'm a coach, I'ma teach these bitches how to lay-up
Now most of y'all can't do shit
But all my chicks cook grits
And roll a spliff at the same damn time
You ain't live long enough to have a bitch this fine
Now if you don't mind

It's 'cause you're my bitch
And as long as no one else call you a bitch

And as long as you don't call after 6
Then there won't be no problems

Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy

Людина літає крил не має

Спробуй і миттю
Полетиш над хмарами
Карбуй
Впусти кохання в свої спогади
Ти наче пісня
Що засіла в голові
Ти наче річка
Омиваєш береги


З тобою літо
Навіть взимку й восени
Ми ніби діти
Босоніж калюжами
Ми наче вітер
Неслися берегом
Замало літер
Щоб описати де ми є
Де ми є

[Verse 1]
An insect trapped in amber, I'm a fading pulse
The ecstasy was false
Our love is an unlit script no one can memorise
Redacted and revised
I'll lie beside you and I'll try to play along
An insect trapped in amber, I'm a static hum
No longer happy dumb

Ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me
It ain't no way for me to give you all you need
If you won't let me give all of me
I know that a woman's duty
Is to help and love a man
And that's the way it was planned
Oh, but how can I, how can I, how can I
Give you all the things I can
If you're tying both of my hands?

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, it ain't no way (Ain't no way)
It ain't no way (Ain't no way)
It just ain't no way, baby (Ain't no way)
Ain't no way, baby (Ain't no way)
It ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me

[Bridge]
Stop trying to be someone you're not
Hard, cold, and cruel is a man
Who paid too much for what he got
And if you need me like you say, say that you do
Oh, then please, please, please
Don't you know that I need you?


[Chorus]
Oh, it ain't no way
I tell you that it ain't no way, it ain't no way, it ain't no way, baby, no
It just ain't no way
It sure ain't no way
It ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me

Wouldn't wanna waste your time
Call you if I change my mind
I'm trying not to be unkind
Still wanted you back on my side
Never wanna make you cry
Pretending everything's all right
Couldn't have you on my doorstep
I wouldn't wanna waste your time

Yeah, I'll meet you in the car on the corner
But we know it's gotta change sometime
You know I love the taste of your water
But I think it's time we say goodbye

But you're never gonna change my mind
You know I wanna stay, but you gotta
Leave because it don't feel right this time, alright

Slipping through the streets all night
Still bruising from your chalk skin bites
Meet you in the car for five
Not sleeping at your place tonight
Monday's always on my mind
Pretending everything's all right
Couldn't have you on my doorstep
I wouldn't wanna waste your time

Yeah, I'll meet you in the car on the corner
But we know it's gotta change sometime
You know I love the taste of your water

It's just impossible
It's impossible- ask a baby not to cry
It's just impossible
Can I hold you closer to me?
And I feel you goin' through me
Split the second that I never think of you
Oh, how impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
It's just impossible
If I had you could I ever want for more?
It's just impossible
And tommorow should you ask me for the world somehow I'd get it
I would sell my very soul and not regret it
For to live without your love is just impossible"

Babe
I got a pretty face
But I'm dying slowly on the inside
Call my friends and tell them that I hate
The way
They say, ""turn that frown right upside down""
Like it's that fucking easy to change my face

[Pre-Chorus]
When I feel like this
I can't move my lips
Everything goes down, down, down, down

[Chorus]
There's a flicker of light
There's always morning after the night
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
There's a flicker of light
Without the dark, the stars can't shine bright
And I'm still alive
I'm still alive

[Verse 2]
I'm a mess
I need to get out of bed
I need to call my mother
Tell her I love her
I didn't mean what I said
This is so intense
I'm so effing depressed
Haven't washed my hair in like a week
And I probably stink of cigarettes


[Pre-Chorus]
When I feel like this
I can't move my lips
Everything goes down, down, down, down

There's a flicker of light
There's always morning after the night
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
There's a flicker of light
Without the dark, the stars can't shine bright
I'm still alive
I'm still alive

Man
I don't really understand
Everyone else is okay
Work on Monday
And I'm sitting here on my arse
TV ain't fun
I think I'm put together wrong
Either god he hates my guts
Or maybe I'm just too far gone


[Chorus]
There's a flicker of light
There's always morning after the night
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
There's a flicker of light
Without the dark, the stars can't shine bright
I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I said I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I'm still alive

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a madman
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

[Chorus]
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

[Verse 2]
Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say


[Chorus]
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more (No)

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
(Carry on) You will always remember
(Carry on) Nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely Heaven waits for you

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest

I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing

They're gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it, I mean thousands
I grew up here 'til it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the door frame

I don't know when you got taller
See our reflection in the water
Off a bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wanted

[Verse 2]
And when I grow up, I'm gonna look up
From my phone and see my life
And it's gonna be just like my recurring dream
I'm at the movies, I don't remember what I'm seeing
The screen turns into a tidal wave
Then it's a dorm room, like a hedge maze
And when I find you
You touch my leg and I insist
But I wake up before we do it


[Chorus]
I don't know how, but I'm taller
It must be something in the water
Everything's growing in our garden
You don't have to know that it's haunted

No, I'm not afraid of hard work

Я рахую пальцем в небі спогади, що в голові
Скоро десь на небесах з тобой зустрінемося ми
Ненормальні діти у очах своїх батьків
Мене сьогодні так накрило — бачу тільки дим
Втім, не розбещений життям, але такий дурний
Ти нагадай знову про себе та мене зігрій
Стій осторонь, подалі: я хочу бути один
Напевно, жити мені краще, коли я сумний

[Куплет 2]
Загубився серед друзів та дешевого бухла
Мені важко щось згадати: сильно колить голова
Нерозумні дії, а за ними і слова
Напевно, до кінця життя я буду сам
Закрию очі — побачу кращий світ
В тому моменті, коли в цьому світі я в землі
Не думай плакати, хоча, як хоч, реви
Все рівно не відчую сльози, на плечі сльози твої

Якщо я вже на колінах
То наврядчи молюся

Хоча
Молитися
Це взагалі як?

Присягатись у вірності ідеалізованому образу і подобі?
Тоді я досить часто займаюсь цим, так

Стирати ті самі коліна в кров від любові?
Це відбувається зі всіма, хто буває у мене вдома
І якби сам господь до мене навідався, це також відбулось би
А може таке вже ставалось
Просто що він забув в той момент подати знак

Тому я пригубила вина
З’їла з чужих рук скибку святого хлібу
Запалила церковні свічки
І навіть запросила когось їх притримати

А на ранок забула події вечора
І от знову розповідаю всім, що атеїстка
Хоча якоїсь ночі мого життя я все-таки увірувала
І відчула господа досить глибоко
В серці
В серці звісно


Так от
Якщо я вже на колінах
(навіть, якщо в церкві)
То скоріше всього я там з кимось
І наврядчи молюся

Просто
Заробляю
Нові
Гріхи

І знаєте, якщо мене за цей вірш посадять
Хтось візьме ще один гріх на душу

Але це вже на їхній совісті
Думаю зможемо відмолити його разом
Щоб це не значило

Амінь"

He gives a nervous smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been going on
She says, ""Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand""

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
""Everything will be alright"", he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid what they've been doing's not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

With every single moment out of place
The wolves are on their way
And I can see through all you've made around you

So look me in the eyes
Know the situation's far from right
Unravel all the lies
That kept us feeling so alone

I hope someday we remember what was lost here
For if love no longer waits for the broken
Where do we go when it all goes away?

To rearrange our lives
Fills us with so much to leave behind
And what we can't deny
Hurts the most when we admit
That love will never bring us home

I hope someday we remember what was lost here
For if love no longer waits for the broken
Where do we go when it all goes away?

I will keep what we've started in my mind, love
Yet I can not help but be brokenhearted and undone now


But I hope that someday we remember what was lost here
For if love no longer waits for the broken
Where do we go when it all goes away?

(We remember what was lost here
For if love no longer waits for the broken
Where do we go)

When it all goes away?"

To touch your lips and hold you tight,oh

And I was going to tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown

But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave without a trace
Where do silent hearts go?

Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Candle in the water, drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder, come and rescue me
Driven by the hunger of the endless dream
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?

That only echoes through the night?

Я водив тебе у бари
Ти вела мене за ніс
Цілувала мої руки
Уявляв тебе у них

Ти любила наркоманів
Серед них був головним
Ти дивилась мов собака
Я казав мяу-мяу кіс-кіс

Ти зі мною ходиш завжди
І в моїх думках ти скрізь
Через тебе моє серце
Стало битися сильніш

Ти мій вкид оксітоцину
Коли я тебе вдихаю
Відчуваю мов літаю

Ріже мене як ножі

І з тобой мої зіниці
Знову ширшими стають
А мороз по моїй шкірі
Мовчки скаже як люблю

Як люблю коли повітря
Перехоплює мені
Через тебе феєрверки
Вибухають в голові

Чому дражниш моїх демонів
І займаєш кожну з memories?
То до сонця підіймаєш
То кидаєш знову в темряву

Спершу кайф а потім паніка
Надприродна аномалія

Дикий страх , нестримна манія

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Oh-oh-oh)

Said I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you

But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

My possessions are causing me suspicion, but there's no proof
In the paper today, tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead, barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
Said my happiness is all of your misery
I put good dick all in my kidneys
This Margiel' don't come with no jealousy

I'm going to glow up one more time
Trust me, I have magical foresight
You gon’ see me sleepin' in courtside
You gon' see me eatin' ten more times
Ugh, you can’t take that bitch nowhere
Ugh, I look better with no hair
Ugh, ain't no sign I can't smoke here
Ugh, gimme the chance and I'll go there (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Doja Cat]
Said pop make money, now you try, bitch
You could use a revamp with a new vibe, sis
I don't need a big feature or a new sidekick
I don't need a new fan 'cause my boo like it
I don't need to wear a wig to make you like it
I'm a two-time bitch, you ain't knew I'd win?
Throw a shot like you tryna have a food fight then
All my opps waitin' for me to be you, I bet
Said I got drive, I don't need a car
Money really all that we fiendin' for
I'm doin' things they ain't seen before
Fans ain't dumb, but extremists are
I'm a demon lord
Fall off what? I ain't seen the horse
Called your bluff, better cite the source
Fame ain't somethin' that I need no more

'Cause, bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red

I'd feel free
In my
Brand new jeans
There's something

I don't believe
A word I said
It's my ambition
That wants me dead
Of every message
Of every text
I hear a voice
I make it stretch

And with his hand in my hand and his voice in my mouth
There's no love in my heart when I'm sitting on thе couch
Throw the bag in the river so it's nеver found out
With a face made of rubber, I get lost in a crowd
It's the stones in his pockets
It's the smell in the air
It's the double sided mirror
It's the change of her hair
It's the snap of her fingers
When she knows you're right there
Make a sceptic a believer
Sitting in my arm chair


[Verse 1]
All I want is
A token of your gratitude
Have you been living in your bunker man?
I know you've got a prepper attitude

I told them take their grace
And send it where it came
Only the generous get to live another day
What is there to try?
There is only to do
So open up your pockets and show me a thing or two

[Verse 2]
All I want is
Heavenly touch of the sun rays
You fill my up like an ocean plastic
I convert your dreams into things
Tangible fantastic

I told them to change their ways
Or risk the end of days
For earth is the only bed in which a man can lay
What is there to consider?
What options left to weigh?
So open your accounts and get on his good side today

All I want is
A picture from your uncle's party
I see beneath all it shape and colour
He's got a tattoo of a poppy!

I tell him here's your chance
To take it all away
The effects of my magic will depend on what you pay
If his grass is greener, I can turn it black today
I'm the crow voice repeating every god damn thing you say

It's the look on his face

But he's in the wrong place
And he won't tell me the truth

And the body of a snake

Canceled a hot hipster threesome for you
'Cause I preach of freedom, but you're a fucking great excuse
Plus I'd rather get naked and swim in your blow-up pool
And dry our dolphin bodies off and question your tattoos

[Chorus]
'Cause he's so pretty when he goes down on me
Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with me

It's such a short drive to get to the touch tank
To you, deep sea pearl, my soft manta ray (Manta ray)
Tender two fingers to touch the display
I used to dive deep 'til I got splashed in the face

He's so pretty when he goes down on me
Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with me

You took my breath away
So now I can't suck in my stomach around you anymore
We're too old to live with our parents
Do you wanna wake up to me every morning?
Every morning
Every morning
I'm swimming into you
I'll tumble to the ocean in a parachute
I am swimming into you
I'll tumble to the ocean

He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be

Your arrogance is stalling
Confidence is falling

As you swap away your clock
For longing to be something more than who you are

She’s needs to know you need to get her

I wish I knew how to understand
I can feel your hatred in my heart
Play all your cards back to front

You love her, I see that (ah)
However your perspective is merely a perspective of right
Of right and wrong
Blind your sight, close the door (ah)
You stupid fool, manipulate your fate

I wish I knew how to understand
I can feel your hatred in my heart
Play all your cards back to front

Drown her in your sins
And frown at me, you know I win
Burn your eyes, you fool
How he flies, you're not that cool
Love her, hate her
Why the fuck did you date her?

Let's paint the picture of the perfect place
They've got it better than when anyone's told ya
They'll be the King of Hearts and you're the Queen of Spades
Then we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers

And their grass is getting greener each day
I know things are looking up, but soon they'll take us down
Before anybody's knowing our name

We can remember swimmin' in December
Headin' for the city lights in 1975
We're sharin' each other, nearer than farther
The scent of a lemon drips from your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

We lived an adventure, love in the summer
Followed the sun 'til night, reminiscing other times of life
For each every other the feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven, we got lost in your eyes

But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believin' now?

To myself that I'm content with loneliness

[Интро: JID]
Курю марихуану, я катаюсь вокруг
Приходи на мою сторону города
В последнее время всё опускалось, опускалось, опускалось, опускалось, опускалось вниз (Смотри, а, смотри)

[Куплет 1: JID]
Все мои ниггеры на моей стороне
В кармане ракета, как Келлен Монд
Мама говорила, что сила в языке
Но он не такой сильный, как оружие
Все вы, мелкие трусы, будете съедены, я раздам цветы любому из вас
Я не выходил из дома ни на минуту, потому что я не там, только если не хватает денег
Я занимался своими делами, я ориентирован на бизнес
Я провёл время с министром
Потому что эти ниггеры запрявляют дерьмом и до сих грешат в божьем городе — это плохо
Попробуйте помолиться и раскаяться в синагоге, мечети, храме или церкви
Эти сантименты коричневых ниггеров обижают
И убийство — это, конечно, нормальность
R.I.P. будет на футболке; ищи, скрывайся — мрак, брызги, грязь, первый (Сорок восемь)
Мой ниггер отбывает четыре плюс восемь без даты суда
Недавно разговаривал с ним — он сказал, что всё отлично
Он в порядке, набирает вес, а потом он получил острый нож
Он всё сделал и говорит, что они так играются, они должны принять участие
У друга сердце полно ненависти, а лицо испачкано краской войны
Глаза красные, наполнены гневом и из этого тёмного места сложно сбежать
Ниггеры всех возрастов с востока Атланты
Пытаются продать фунт из своей собачьей клетки
Все OG в городе нашего возраста
Опасность, секс и наркотики — рейтинги X и R получены
Опасность, секс и наркотики — это дерьмо возмутительно
Но не доводи это дерьмо до крайностей, мой друг
Сначала тебе повезло, потом ты удвоился
Я был с мячом, передал его к кольцу и утроил своё удвоение
Подберись к кольцу, забери выйгрыш и держи его близко к себе
Прикрой его, собери его, разбей его (Разбей его)
Говоришь много бреда, но я могу поддержать
Малышка хочет секса, да, хочет секса
Я могу положить её киску на блюдце, как утконос
Кудрявый ниггер, волосы взъерошенны
Я сказал: «Барбара» — ниггерша с татуировками
Я не буду ругаться, ниггер ебать как расстроился
Потому что они несовместимы, я скоро катапультируюсь
Но ниггеры знают, что это всё опускалось
(Вниз, вниз, вниз, вниз, вни-ни-ни-ни—)


[Припев: Eminem]
Что, если у меня закончится топливо? Оно не закончится
Что вы будете делать, если у меня не закончится топливо?
(Вниз, вниз, вниз, вниз, вни-ни-ни-ни—)
Это пиздец как вас напугает

С той секунды, с которой ты нажимаешь «Играть» (Что?)
Я предлагаю вам (Что?)
Не проверять это, как эссе (Почему?)

Называй меня «ожирение» (Почему?)
Ты думаешь, что всё закончилось? Стой, это только начало
Задиссь меня, и это перестанет быть хорошим (Неа)
Раньше был одного роста, а потом я каждый день понемногу рос до тех пор, пока не стал богом

И это не звуковой эффект (Воу)
И это тоже не он, SIG Sauer стреляет
Я не намерен мириться со скулшутингом (Неа)
Но я не могу убрать эти голоса из моей головы (Хей, погнали, раз, два)
Они закидывают слова в мой рот как суп из алфавита
Имею содержимого больше, чем на всём континенте
И моментальные комплименты дают мне уверенность
(Я — это) Что-то между обычным смыслом и некомпетентностью (А)
Я понимаю, что конфликты — это последствия (Что?)
Достижений, которые я получил сквозь соревнование
Если бы Кон мог бы ударить его так, что он упадёт без сознания
Хоть я в сознании, я представляю Кинг Конга и просто
Называй меня «Камикадзе», я полностью заряжен (Воу, виноват)
Ничьи М-16 не достаточно сильны
Эти ёбаные указательные пальцы стреляют через ТЕК-9
Через эти 9 миллиметров, я понижаю градус
У меня есть тостер, как английский маффин
Стой, я имел ввиду «тост за», типо ты выпиваешь за что-то
Но он в кобуре, а я перехожу к выстрелам
И просто веселюсь, а потом меня застрелят, как Халину Хатчинс
Будто я — это Алек Болдуин; я имел ввиду то, что я ложу тебя на землю
Смертельный выстрел, прямо между глаз
Застрелю всех; если ты думаешь, что имеешь дело со мной
Тебе придётся разгребать последствия
Жрец смерти идёт по души язычников, мне нужно это
Я заправляюсь дальше, пока бью бит


[Припев: Eminem]
Что, если у меня закончится топливо? Оно не закончится
Что вы будете делать, если у меня не закончится топливо?

When I was young and stupid
My love left to be a rock and roll star
He told me, ""Please, don't worry""
Wise little smile that spoke so safely
He booked a one-way ticket
Out west, that's where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches

[Verse 2: Dave Bayley]
He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewelry​
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon
He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool, but
My life turns in slow motion

[Chorus: Dave Bayley]
Bye-bye, baby, blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killin' you
Screamin' at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But, I settle for a ghost


[Verse 3: Dave Bayley]
Where I was from, in NOLA
No one left to be a rock and roll star
He'd stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby
I miss him, don't you blame me?
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust
He's chasin' that pappy pipe dream

[Bridge: Dave Bayley]
(Ooh, ooh)
I know you don't, but I—
I know you don't, but I still try
My thunder shook him down
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone, but I—
That girl is gone, but I still try
I think it's over now
The bullet hit, but maybe not
I feel so fuckin' numb
It hits my head, and I feel numb
My body's lookin' wrong
My body's lookin' wrong
My body's lookin' wrong


[Chorus: Dave Bayley]
Bye-bye, baby, blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killin' you

Давай звільнимось від цього одягу, сорому

Тримати дим в своїх легенях

І весь вечір пройшов як хвилина відтоді як
Попала у кров

Time shakes, found you at the water
At first you were my father
Now I love you like a brother
Earthquakes shake the dust behind you
This world at times will blind you
Still I know I'll see you there

Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been dreamin'?
Come a little closer, then you'll see

Will we burn on or just smolder?
Somehow I know I'll find you there
Ooh, you wanna see if you can change it, change it
Still I know I'll see you there

The song holds a very eerie aura to it and explores the troubles in a relationship based solely around sex and not emotional connection.[Verse 1]
You mean that much to me
And it's hard to show
Gets hectic inside of me
When you go
Can I confess these things
To you
Well I don't know
Embedded in my chest
And it
Hurts to hold

I couldn't spill my heart
My eyes gleam looking in from the dark
I walk out in stormy weather
Hold my words, keep us together
Steady walking but bound to trip
Should release but just tighten my grip

[Chorus]
Night time
Sympathize
I've been working on
White lies
So I'll tell the truth
I'll give it up to you
And when the day comes
It will have all been fun
We'll talk about it soon

And I couldn't spill my heart
My eyes gleam
Looking in from the dark
And I walk out in stormy weather
Hope my words keep us together

Для кульгавого серця – обійми твої, ніби милиці
Скажи, коли це закінчиться?
Скажи, коли все закінчиться?

Я б хотіла забути про тебе, зрівняти минуле з землею
Та душа моя знову чомусь так наївно прагне твоєї
Серед хмар білі смуги залишені літаком в русі
Їм судилось завжди бути поруч є, але вони не перетнуться

Може хтось піде а хтось залишиться один
Може я

Твої руки прикрашені ледь помітними смугами
У нас завжди хтось буде першим а хтось буде другим?
Єдине, що я б поміняв повернувшись в минуле
Я б лишив тебе другом, мила, лишив тебе другом

Ми з різних світів і ми дивимось у різні сторони
Я ховався від тебе в диму, вже легені як ворони
Ти взяла стільки болю, від мене, взяла стільки лиха
Та єдина проблема, вибач, всередині тихо

Dear summer, wе've been runnin' the numbers
Wе just shy off a billi’, sold my crib to Madonna
Might connect to my father, I don't know that nigga
Tryna end all my dramas, tryna clean up my closet
'Cause the media hate it when they can never control us
And my enemies hate it 'cause I own my soul
I know (I know)
When they think I don't, I know (I know)
I know (I know)
And they try to fuckin' kill me, spreadin' misinformation
Tryna paint me a villain
Guess I did it to myself, man, this business life pimping
Who can tell me the difference?
Dealt with scarier situations, I had nowhere to live in
High school dropout, chillin' with academics
Now I can finish a sentence
Now I’m articulate, baby
And I enunciate, baby
And I eviscerate my enemies and piss on they grave, yeah
And I swear I’m gon' do it, I know


[Chorus: Tommy Parker & The Weeknd]
I can’t wait to get there, I know
Every time I look into those eyes (I know, know, know, know, know)
All the tears drop down your face (I know, know, know)
I can't wait to get there, aware, my heart (I get the game, I know)
I wish I could get there to know (You need the right complexion for the right protection, for the right intention, for the, for the, for the)
Where my love can grow (For the, for the right, for the right, ooh)
Every time I look into those eyes
Look into those eyes and all the tears drop down your face (I can't wait to get there, woah, oh)
Aware, my heart
I wish I could get there to know
Where my love can grow, oh, oh
I can't wait to get there, I know

Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real-time world, no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

[Pre-Chorus]
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

[Chorus]
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

[Verse 2]
On the ice-blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it
You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night


[Pre-Chorus]
There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

[Chorus]
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

I'm starin' at a broken door
There's nothin' left here anymore
My room is cold, it's makin' me insane
I've been waitin' here so long
But now, the moment seems to have come
I see the dark clouds comin' up again

[Chorus]
Runnin' through the monsoon, beyond the world
To the end of time where the rain won't hurt
Fightin' the storm, into the blue
And when I lose myself, I think of you
Together, we'll be runnin' somewhere new
Through the monsoon
Just me and you

[Verse 2]
A half-moon's fadin' from my sight
I see your vision in its light
But now, it's gone and left me so alone
I know I have to find you now
Can hear your name, I don't know how
Why can't we make this darkness feel like home?

[Chorus]
Runnin' through the monsoon, beyond the world
To the end of time where the rain won't hurt
Fightin' the storm, into the blue
And when I lose myself, I think of you
Together, we'll be runnin' somewhere new
And nothing can hold me back from you
Through the monsoon


[Post-Chorus]
Hey
Hey

I'm fightin' all its power comin' in my way
Let it take me straight to you, I'll be runnin' night and day
I'll be with you soon
Just me and you
We'll be there soon
So soon

Runnin' through the monsoon, beyond the world
To the end of time where the rain won't hurt
Fightin' the storm, into the blue

Together, we'll be runnin' somewhere new
And nothing can hold me back from you

South of Market in the land of ruin
You get all manner of action
Tinsel tigers in The Metal Room
Stalking satisfaction
They got them packaged up for love and money
Tattooed tots and chrome spike bunnies
Check my conscience at the DMZ
And roll on in, going to roll in it, honey
But I get a feeling like when big things collide
Like the crack before the thunder, like I really ought to hide
And here comes Metal Angel, she looks ready to ride
And what's that she's trying to show me?
What's that you're trying to show me?

Picasso Moon, shattered light
Diamond bullets ripping up the night
Picasso Moon, liberate me
From the middle of eternity
Something hooks her little finger at me
And it's bigger than a drive-in movie, ooooo-eeee
Bigger than a drive-in movie, ooooo-eeee

Hanging ten out on space and time
Redefining distance
The next skull on your necklace is mine
Cheap for such assistance
I had a job trading bits for pieces
We'd make wrinkles, advertise them as creases
Please, find my resignation enclosed
Roll with it, roll with it, we going to roll in it, honey

So strange, you'll do me all that you do
Dark Angel, you're making me blue
I guess it doesn't matter [x2]

Raring out, I'm going to testify
And stare a shout into that burning eye

Scramble back to cover
Quick, pop your mirrored sunglasses on
My little leather-winged lover
I see your face printed on my money
Your blazing ways really move me, honey

Why'm I laughing? This ain't funny
Dark Angel, now just don't start
You'll break my spirit, wreck my heart
You must have a license for practicing that art

When I'm lonely, that's when I'll burn it

Її сітка — це чотири вулиці
Я нарешті бачив дивовижний сон
Пробудився з посмішкою на лиці

Що як просто до спогадів старих
Додавати дрібку спогадів нових?
Туга за минулим, наче білий шум
Спогади накочуються звідусіль
Спогади про радість викликають сум
Спогади про біль лиш повертають біль

Call you out, call me rude
And I'll show you
If you don't like me now
You're gonna hate me later
Speak now or forever hold your peace
You're gonna hate me later
Speak now or forever hold your peace

Simple gossip keeps the young mind at ease
I know your kind I know the webs that you weave
How do I get past the past (The past)
I'm still hung up on cobwebs
I lasted this long in a paper house
Dopamine will kick in when I hit the ground
Oh, how do I get past the past (The past)
I'm still hung up on cobwebs

And I can't go back to that, no
I'm gonna leave you soon 'cause

This will be the last song about you and your voodoo doll fetish
There's a difference in visiting a memory and living in the past
I've lasted this long as a rubber ball
You pick me up and throw me up against the wall
How do I get past the past (The past)
I'm still hung up on cobwebs

Waking up done
Late in the day
Light used up at night
Wired so tight
Simple decay
Friends, oh, where are them?
Where will I fall?
Where will I end?

Lend some confidence
So I can get past the past-tense

When we went and met
In the same hall
I can't forget

Still dying inside
It's too late to win
It's too late to hide

We were meant to die painfully"

Одного зимового ранку
Я била тихесенько посуд
А ти у сусідній кімнаті
Так мило кричав: «Істеричка, ну досить»
Одного зимового ранку
Цей ранок став ранком тим самим
Ми, ніби студенти, забили на пару, а виявилось, це екзамен

Такі молоді: я в айті, ти — водій
Забагато людей, забагато подій
Забагато брехні, забагато надій

Давно уже складені речі
Вже місяць відтоді
Я ніби пливу проти течії
І ти обіймаєш за плечі
І кажеш замов щось на вечір
Лишитись здавалось безпечніше
Та я будувала план втечі
Одного зимового ранку
За тиждень до Нового року
Я просто стомилась образи і біль
Називати черговим уроком
І ось ти так солодко спиш
І навіть як спиш, ти the best of the best
А я просто слухаю тишу
А чую себе

Drive until you lose the road

And if I recover
Will you be my comfort?
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any colour

Open the envelope

I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me
I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me

Blow by blow
Honest in every way I know
You appear
To face the decision I know you fear

[Chorus]
And if I recover
Will you be my comfort
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any colour

Open the envelope

(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming 'round
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes

[Refrain]
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart

[Verse 2]
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit restless
And I dream of something wild
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit helpless
And I'm lying like a child in your arms
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit angry
And I know I've got to get out and cry
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit terrified
But then I see the look in your eyes


[Refrain]
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart

[Chorus]
And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together, we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (All of the time)
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Once upon a time, I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time, there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

Who wanted me the way that I am

Every now and then, I know there's no one in the universe
As magical and wondrous as you

Every now and then, I know there's nothing any better
There's nothing that I just wouldn't do

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said, nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

You know I'm impatient
So why would you leave me waiting outside the station
When it was like minus four degrees?
And I, I get what you're sayin'
I just really don't wanna hear it right now
Can you shut up for like once in your life?
Listen to me
I took your nice words of advice about
How you think I'm gonna die lucky if I turned thirty-three
Okay, so yeah, I smoke like a chimney
I'm not skinny and I pull a Britney
Every other week
But cut me some slack, who do you want me to be?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm too messy, and then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job"", then you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect till I open my big mouth
I want to be me, is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever, and then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry unless it's that time of the month
And I'm too perfect till I show you that I'm not
A thousand people I could be for you and you hate the fucking lot

You still don't get the hint, I'm not asking for pages
But one text or two would be nice
And, please, don't pull those faces
When I've been out working my arse off all day
It's just one bottle of wine or two
But, hey, you can't even talk
You smoke weed just to help you sleep
Then why you out gettin' stoned at 4 o'clock?
And then you come home to me
And don't say hello
'Cause I got high again
And forgot to fold my clothes

'Cause I'm too messy, and then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job"", then you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect till I open my big mouth

And I'm too clever, and then I'm too fucking dumb

I know you’re aching to be saved
From all the bullshit and banality
Sacredly I have watched you grow
You’ve conquered all the self-loathing and high hopes (All the self-loathing)

[Verse 2]
I saw you giving me the signs
The perfect picture that you get my life
Now all my other gods are dead
Hallelujah to the apocalypse in my head (In my head)

Knock knock, I am here for you
Who’s there? Just the eternal fool
I will be your shadow
I will follow you, never let you go
I will be your shadow
I will follow you, never let you go

[Verse 3]
You are a siren in my dark
You need me now like I’ve needed you from the start
I will protect you from yourself
I will never let the anger consume or destroy you again


[Chorus]
Knock knock, I am here for you
Who’s there? Just the eternal fool
I will be your shadow
I will follow you, never let you go

I will follow you, never let you go

There's no ground when you fall for me
You'll be fallin' for miles
I'm bewitched by your misery
But I love it when y﻿ou smile
Let me know what you want from me
Whisper low in my ears
Before you try to get your hoo﻿ks in me
I should warn you, my dear

[Chorus]
My heart is a haunted house
Once you're in you ain't gettin' out
It's the trap you've been waitin' for
Ain't no windows, ain't no door
No escapin' the way you feel
It's like a dream but you hope it's real
My, my, my heart
M-m-m-m-m-my heart is a haunted (haunted house)

[Verse 2]
Watch your step when you walk to me
Careful where your heart treads
Suddenly you'll be in too deep
You'll be caught up in my web
You will think of me constantly
It'll drive you insane
Like the tattoo you can't remove
Like the blood in your veins


[Chorus]
My heart is a haunted house
Once you're in you ain't gettin' out
It's the trap you've been waitin' for

From the moment you walked in
From the way you had your makeup on
From the way you'd done your hair
From the way you sat down next to me
From the way you ordered your drink
From the moment you put your hand on my knee
I knew I'd have you with ease
Do you come here often?
Do you know how this thing works?
Do you go to bed with a different man every night?
Don't tell me I'm the first

And I want you to sit down next to me, as if by chance
I want it to seem like we've never met before
How much will that cost? I want you to look unsure of yourself
And I want you to look at me as if I'm attractive
I want your eyes to say, ""Take me""
And I want your lips to be unimpressed
And I want you to ask the waiter if I really am who I say I am
And I want you to blush
I want you to shoot a smug look at the other girls
To make them jealous I chose you
When I tell you your pussy is holy
I want you to slap me and then kiss me
Make sure everybody's watching, kiss me and then walk away
Walk to the bathroom, I'll follow after
Don't worry, we won't do anything, we'll just loiter there fifteen minutes or so
Then I'll choose your new lipstick and we'll walk back out
And I want you to tell me I'm a perfect dancer
And I want you to tell me I smell great
I want you to make me look taller
Could you kneel down the whole time? How much will that cost?
I want you to put your hand on my knee
Will that be alright?
I want you to look at me as if you're lost
How much will that cost?

Як добре, що ти довіряєш мені
Всі мої глухі кути
Так любиш ти любиш ти

[Куплет 1]
На самоті попід дахом я криком лунаю сухо
Я скоса лягаю усмішкою, боляче стиглою на вуста
Та навіть крокуючи в прірву, ти все ще тримаєш мене за руку
І разом, я вірю знайдемо потрібний шлях

Хочеться знищити той мотив, який мене розбудив
Світ тебе виплюнув, народив, хоч ти цього не просив
Сльози висохнуть, та шрами залишаться отут
Не чіпай мене руками (ні-ні) в мені отрута

Каже, що злітають перед тим, як вниз упасти
Думки тріскотять, як кісточки в собачій пащі
Все навколо верещить, що я пропаща

А хіба ні?
У мені стільки провини, що від неї можна посивіти
Все життя я доводжу щось, все життя я блукаю десь
Чужими вустами, чужими ідеями, а мої де?
Куди усе це іде і коли це мине та ще безліч питань, які не мають відповідей

Сльози висохнуть, та шрами залишаться отут
Не чіпай мене руками (ні-ні) в мені отрута

Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
And soon it will be morning

And I mustn't give in

And a new day will begin

Don't bring around a cloud
To rain on my parade

Don't tell me not to fly

Who told you you're allowed
To rain on my parade?

I'll march my band out
I'll beat my drum
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat, sir
At least I didn't fake it
Hat, sir, I guess I didn't make it

But whether I'm the rose
Of sheer perfection
Or freckle on the nose
Of life's complexion
The cinder or the shiny apple of its eye


I gotta fly once
I gotta try once
Only can die once, right, sir?
Ooh, life is juicy
Juicy and you see
I gotta have my bite, sir

Get ready for me, love
'Cause I'm a ""comer""
I simply gotta march
My heart's a drummer
Don't bring around a cloud
To rain on my parade

I'm gonna live and live now
Get what I want, I know how
One roll for the whole shebang
One throw, that bell will go clang
Eye on the target and wham
One shot, one gun shot and bam
Hey, Mr. Arnstein, here I am

I'll march my band out
I will beat my drum
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat, sir
At least I didn't fake it
Hat, sir, I guess I didn't make it


Get ready for me, love
'Cause I'm a ""comer""
I simply gotta march
My heart's a drummer
Nobody, no, nobody
Is gonna rain on my parade"

'Cause my hands shake when you're close
So make my dreams come true

Scary movie night and you scooch over like we're almost kissing

Shoots me down bang, bang, bang
Heading out of bed got this boomerang
Always comes back harder than I thought

When my worlds they collapse
And I fall towards the ground


Would you, would you make it disappear

It may keeps on coming back
And leaves without filling my desire
When you got nothing left to lose there is nothing left to choose

How we used to pick you 'cause you was a symbol

But I guess the coils and kinks bеcame an issue
Therefore, bitch, I killed you, Jheris and Mimis (Mimis)

You are my crown, without the grease, really fine
Got the kinks in they mind they gotta ease

I've spent up everyone's goodwill?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Sat on the hood, out all night
Trying to scrape together change
You pulled a moth out
From the grill of your truck
Saying it's a shame
How come it's so much еasier
With anything less than human
Letting yoursеlf be tender?
Well, you couldn't make me do it


[Chorus]
It doesn't feel too bad, but it
Doesn't feel too good, either
Just like a nicotine patch, it
Hardly works, then it's over

[Bridge]
Who put me
In your way to find?
And what right had you
Not to let me die?
Ooh, but did I even know
What I was asking for?
If I had my way
I'd have missed you more
Than you missed me
You missed me

[Outro]
You missed me
You missed me"

Why did I have to meet you?
I was happy where I was
And now I'm wondering what we could do
And I'm lost, I'm lost
Why is this always the way it goes?
Dreaming of a future life with somebody random
And now I'm wondering what we could know
And I'm lost, I'm lost

[Chorus]
Oh, somebody, come through
Tell me why the way you look at me is so confusing
Oh-woah, why do I feel stupid?
Tell me, do you want me now? Or I'll just play it cool, kid

Here we go again
Back in the same places
Why? Oh, why do I still feel
Like nothing ever changes?

How do I fall for it every time?
This time, you and I, we misaligned
For a moment, I was paralysed
But now I'm lost, I'm lost

You did your time with someone else

And now we're one, tangled up in our room
And I was tough, raised by wolves
You made me soften with that smile of yours
You're dancing and I'm standing on your shoes

[Pre-Chorus]
We've had blessings, we've been cursed
They try to end us with their words

[Chorus]
I crossed the seas into the oceans
And my ship wrecked into you
Now I see the world through red emotions
How'd you take away the color blue?
Can't believе I get to have it
Slay the dragons for this lеgendary love
Legendary love
Love

[Verse 2]
I was told I was built for something grand
I'd rule alone until I found a worthy man
Then you washed up on the shore
Out of the rock, you pulled the sword
And you put it in my hand


[Chorus]
I crossed the seas into the oceans
And my ship wrecked into you
Now I see the world through red emotions
How’d you take away the color blue?
Can't believe I get to have it
Slayed the dragons for this legendary love
Legendary love
Love

[Outro]
You get broken, then it happens
Drown in tears, and then you're laughing
And it's wilder than I imagined
Look at us
Now the past a cemetery
You're a legend and I swear we
Got to sing to heaven, legendary love

You talk down to me pretty bad
I edit things you said when I tell my friends about it
But when they’re in my head, sometimes I recognize
There might be a little truth to it
I can’t live this way, always on the back foot
Say it’s being back in LA that makes me anxious
Behind the canyon of my ego, I know it's just my sadness

[Chorus]
Crashin', makin' memories of madness
Laughin' so hard I can't stand it
Classic, all I’m good at is ruining you (Ooh)
Vanish, disappear like a hat trick
Laughin', like some old washed up has-been
Actress, my best work is ruining you
I could've been a star (Ooh)
I could've been a star (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Might be a little darker than I prеtended, maliciously intendеd to hurt you
I wish that nothing was buried under the surface and maybe I could properly love you
Can’t say I’m proud but I’m still fond of our youth
You came in as a master and let me rule you
I swear I didn't mean to break all hell loose


[Chorus]
Crashin', makin' memories of madness
Laughin' so hard I can't stand it
Classic, all I’m good at is ruining you

Swore you off again, but there's some kind of smoke circling up ahead

'Cause the devil's love's got a hell of a grip on
Got a hell of a grip on

Gets me in trouble every time
Yeah, I always think twice and go back for a third time
I go back for a third time

[Verse 2]
You got your sickness back
I'm the only one around who could help with that
Think with all my fences, I'd have learned my lesson
Got no money for the rent, know the check's gon' bounce
'Cause I spent it on the times I had to bail you out
If you're dancing with my hopes, I'd never tell
God, it feels good to abandon myself

[Chorus]
Me and my drifter mind
Hot in the water, lost in the tide
Yeah, I always think twice and go back for a third time
Common sense don’t get me far
Excuses made for the man that you are
Yeah, I always think twice, but I still wonder why I
I go back for a third time


[Bridge]
Ooh
Over and over, I forgot how it happened
Count all the days I surrendered to heaven
You love me here, then you leave me abandoned
Yeah, you leave me abandoned

[Chorus]
Me and my drifter mind
Hate you in the day, love you at night
Yeah, I always think twice, then go back for a third time

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

[Chorus]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

[Verse 2]
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear


[Chorus]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on

Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone, it's a lonelier place

But down inside, you know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall but I give you it all

To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right I defend over and over again
What do I do?

In love there is no measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I live in each other's heart
We may be oceans away

And forsake this solid ground
And give up this fear within

As around the sun, the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing, will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

[Verse 2]
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day?
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
As today, I know I'm living, but tomorrow
Could make me the past, but that, I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always


[Refrain]
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Did you know you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)

[Bridge]
We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truth and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)

One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four hands and then away

Wouldn't be good enough

The start a simple touch
One night to push and scream

Ten days of perfect hues

Я сльози твої не відрізнив би
Від блиску діадем, як у королеви школи
Я пограбую всі магазини з ними, щоб про мене почула ти
Волосся розпусти, вона пасує тобі
Новою ти станеш, а я залишусь там
І ти мокра, я бачу все що на тобі
Прозорим, це личить так
Як блонд твоїм очам
Тече макіяж, чи вистачить прикрас?
Чи вони справжні?
Не такі як ти, нікому не кажи про довгий коридор like in horror films
Торкнись так, ніби у кінці не одна
Я прийму любу форму - ти промокла
Не знімай джинс, не втрачай смак
Незвичайний флірт чи щось на кшталт
Рухи твоїх очей схожі на ґвалт
Новою ти станеш, а я залишусь там
І ти мокра, я бачу все що на тобі
Прозорим, це личить так
Як блонд твоїм очам
Забери мене звідси
Забери мене
У тобі вірус
Його жене серце під шкіру
Бентежне
У тобі вірус і рани вблизь
Вірус, поділись"

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror

Take a look at yourself and then make a change

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

Якщо ти моя, порину і заберу все
Я поруч з нею — корумпований нардеп, та поза фракції
Ти двічі кажеш: «Ні, Дім, я образилась»
За п'ять хвилин тремтиш, давши лице, ніби ніщо не трапилось
Я розганяю її, як перший спорткар
Ми випадково стукнулись зубами, зіткнення як трапеза
ЇЇ пластичність — я згадую бальні танці
Та бойові мистецтва нині мені ближче
Бо на питання «Як ти?» — я кажу: «Облиште»
А-а, закохатися у тебе — як стрибати з парашутом
Знаючи, що він ніколи розкриється
Але літак на висоті мого лібідо
Якщо я не наважусь, то штовхнуть у спину

With brains that could explain

And I'd play pretend, hoping one day

And I'd have a story, they'd know my name

Other half of my story is with me forever

Careful what you ask, love for the ages
When it's good all on the outside, part of the faking
You can't write the ending, it's Hollywood pages
You tell them your story and they'll make the changes

Scream my lungs out

Break 'em
Shit
Ah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog (Damn)
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out (What's up?)
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day (Shit)


[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin', ""Domino""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.​ 
Today was a good day (Shit)

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid (Word)
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep, put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun (Yeah)
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out (Uh)
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day (Shit)

And I just stand there
It's been a while since I heard my own voice
I just stand there
Just before she says that she loves me
She loves me
She loves me
(How I made you f—)
I sit with the night in appreciation
Of this ability to hear a world
I'm alive
I'm alive and I can feel it
(I just wanted to be safe)
She loves me
(I just wanted to be safe)
And I just stand there
And my one-bed apartment feels like a coliseum
I feel prеtty, but in a handsome way
(I just wanted to be safе)
She loves me
(I just wanted to be safe)
And I just stand there
And she looks at me like she's taking photos
Just stood laughing
At full lung capacity
And the first crunch of Tayto cheese and onion crisps
I'm wide-eyed at the window
(I just wanted to be safe)
And I just stand there
(I just wanted to be safe)
And I just
And we spent sunrise to sundown in my room
Glued to the window, watching all the people go about their lives
And we decided their futures for them and ugly laughed
And I remember thinking to myself
""Don't you dare get used to this""
""Don't you dare"" (Don't you dare)
Felt like all four seasons happened in one day
And I just stand there laughing at you
'Cause I can't believe this is real
And I just stand there
And I just

To put my heart on the table for
Somebody to eat

Or chase the boredom away""

Lose another chance to break away
From all I cannot bear
I suffer through the shame
Wishing hope would just abandon me
Till this is over

My loveless life
I'm lost in you tonight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down

Time and time again
Take it all and take the fall for you
Fear is all I hold
Bound and beaten down
All the pain I can't escape today
Is always with me

My loveless life
I'm lost in you tonight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down
My darkest night
Your arms that hold me tight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down


All my love is lost
All my hope is gone
All my love is lost
All my hope is gone

My loveless life
I'm lost in you tonight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down
My darkest night
Your arms that hold me tight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down"

When the stars are too cold
Frozen over the glow
On the edge of the night
We can be their light
So give me more than your touch
And give yourself to the rush
Just keep holding my hand
As we're taking off
I know where we'll land

[Chorus]
We can escape to a higher plane
In Nirvana, stay
Where the dreamers lay
I'll lay you down, lay you down
Safe on a higher plane
In Nirvana, stay
Where the dreamers lay
I'll lay you down, lay you down

[Verse 2]
Through the dark there's a way
There's a love, there's a place
Where we don't have to hide
We can dream all night
So follow me through the sky
And watch the oceans collide
Just keep holding my hand
As we're taking off
I know where we'll land


[Chorus]
We can escape to a higher plane
In Nirvana, stay
Where the dreamers lay
And I'll lay you down, lay you down
Safe on a higher plane
In Nirvana, stay
Where the dreamers lay
I'll lay you down, lay you down

[Bridge]
Oh, we don't need any diamonds or gold
Watch the mystic and cryptic unfold
As we fly high

We can escape to a higher plane
In Nirvana, stay
Where the dreamers lay
And I'll lay you down, lay you down
Safe on a higher plane
In Nirvana stay
Where the dreamers lay
I'll lay you down, lay you down
I'll lay you down, lay you down

Ruined my credit, stole my cute aesthetic
Who knew that we'd let it
Get this bad when it ended?

If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
And let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't—
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high

Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

You are my church, you are my place of worship
I heard you're the plug, can I be the circuit?
When I got court, I hope that you're the verdict
When you're around, my insides turn inverted
My blood start to rush when I see you, doorman
I know you're nearby and I know your purpose
Take one look at you
You're heaven's incarnate
What is this spell, baby?
Please show some mercy

[Chorus]
Melting like an ice cream when you smile
Melting, you're a daydream
Stay a while

[Verse 2]
I pray that I can learn to be funny
I'm watching every stand-up comedy
Just hoping that it will rub off on me
So you'll smile at everything I say
You got some soft lips and some pearly whites (pearly whites)
I wanna touch them in the dead of night (dead of night)
Your smile ignites just like a candlelight (candlelight)
Then somehow I know everything's alright

Melting like an ice cream when you smile
Melting, you're a daydream
Stay a while
Melting like an ice cream when you smile

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Zwrotka 1: Childish Gambino]
Jestem tylko chłopakiem ze wsi w Georgii
Twoje ciało jest stworzone dla Kalifornii, kochanie
Twój mężczyzna nie robi nic innego, tylko cię uwielbia
Ale zastanawiam się, co by powiedział?
Wyglądasz tak dobrze, nie mogę sobie na ciebie pozwolić
On całował twoje usta, to wyglądało jak tortura dla ciebie
To, że jesteś słodka, nie czyni cię lojalną
I zastanawiam się, co by powiedział?

[Refren: Childish Gambino]
Jeśli w nocy śnię o tobie
Nie ma znaczenia, co robię
W nocy śnię o tobie
Każdej nocy śnię o tobie

[Post-refren: Jorja Smith]
Musiałam się skradać
Bo on nigdy nie mógłby się dowiedzieć, że
Nigdy nie chciałam szczęścia
Chcę tylko być z tobą
Wiem, że ściągnąłbyś mnie w dół
Ale wiesz, że wiem, że
Ty też mnie potrzebujesz
W nocy


[Zwrotka 2: Jorja Smith]
Uśmiecham się do niego codziennie
Wczoraj wieczorem powiedziałam, że to jego dziecko
O nie, próbuję cię ujrzeć, gdy zamykam oczy
Jeśli on się dowie, może oszaleć

[Refren: Jorja Smith, Childish Gambino i Jorja Smith]
Bo w nocy śnię o tobie
Nie ma znaczenia co robię
W nocy śnię o tobie
Ale zastanawiam się przez cały dzień

[Post-refren: Jorja Smith, Childish Gambino i Jorja Smith, Childish Gambino]
Musiałam się skradać (Skradać)
Bo on nigdy nie mógłby się dowiedzieć, że

Wiem, że ściągnąłbyś mnie w dół
Ale wiesz, że wiem, że (Ty)
Ty też mnie potrzebujesz
W nocy

[Zwrotka 3: Amaarae]
Czy wszystko w porządku? W porządku?
Widziałam cię z tym typem, powiedziałam: ""Nie ma mowy, nie ma mowy""
Skradałaś się i złapałam sukę na gorącym uczynku, w 4K, w 4K
Całujesz suki, teraz lecisz na dwa fronty, okej
Czy wszystko w porządku? W porządku?
Czy to w twojej kieszeni, dziewczyno, to kokaina? Kokaina?
""On jest tylko przyjacielem"" - tak wszyscy mówią, wszyscy mówią
Suko, wiesz, że musimy się spotkać w mój wolny dzień, wolny dzień

We were just two moonshiners on the cusp of a breath
And I've been burning for you baby since the minute I left"

The world was on fire

And I wanna fall in love

A hundred times I said those words
Those words others wrote
With all my voice, with all my soul

The hard work in the cotton fields
I was imagining in my cocoon
The hits, the blood, the mud weather
I was hurt while closing my eyes
His baby's far away[x2]
I have forgives, I have prayers
But the blues isn't sentences you throw in the air
I woke up this morning baby[x2]

You understand deep in your chest
All the blues are written for you
Oh, oh I feel, the blues in me
Nobody knows how I really feel
Nobody knows, nobody cares""
Oh, oh I feel, the blues in me
Nobody knows how I really feel

500,бути долбайобом,jockii druce,"6 Contributorsбути долбайобом (to be a dumbass) Lyrics[Текст пісні «бути долбайобом»]

[Частина I]
Життя це не дуже весела хуйня
Викупать тут по суті нічого нема
Походи, щоб поспать — поїси, щоб посрать
Там побігай, подєлай шось ну і опять
А мрії згасають і роки пливуть
Кенти помирають, коліна гніють
Щоб зовсім не йобнутись тут від тоски
Ну, можна послухать якісь блять казки
Які блять казки? Єслі хочеш — про себе
Шо ти не людина, а, поняв, син неба
І зорі на небі багато шо значать
Іди за своєю і буде удача
А які ще казки? Єслі хочеш — про інших
Шо люди бувають такі-то, такі-то
І от той перечень стислих ідей
Щоб завдяки ним і сприймати людей
Та це навіть ахуєнно, знаєш, вірити у шось
Коли дитина вірить, що існує дєд Мороз
А подарки під подушку ложе святий Івангай
Це просто ахуєнно. Якщо вірить — то нехай
Ти ж не будеш їй доказувать: «Ну це все не в серйоз»
Тебе трочешка найобують, який ще дєд Мороз?
А буває, що в казки вірить здоровий, сука, лоб
Дивишся і думаєш: «Дружищє, ти шо долбайоб нахуй?»
Провокативна тема і треба дивиться в оба
Нікому не до вподоби оказаться долбайобом
Демократія передбачає вільний хід думок
Ми, блять, не в середньовіччі і це більше, аніж ок
Як із твоїми казками хтось чучуть не соглашається
А його не посадять, йому навіть розрішається
Сказать «Та ти їблан, твої ідеї це апатія»
Це ще, якщо ти віриш, що існує демократія
А самі жосткі казки це завжди про політику
Не нада буть експєртом і не нада аналітиком
Одні, бля, помирають, інші пиздуна ганяють
Їм же нада шось пообсуждать - вони шось обсуждають
Оце от хороші, оце от погані
Оце там диктатор, оце в них папаня
Все стало понятно, але самий сок
Колективна свідомість у формі казок
Ну дивись, кожен день ти дєлаєш якийсь вибір
Одіться з комфортом чи так, шоб помітили
Пить чи не пить, курить — не курить
З тіпом пообщаться чи поговорить
Чи нахуй послать, з гандоном чи без
Чи Мюнхен, чи Київ, чи долар, чи тезер
На фронт ти пішов або дома посидів
Кожного з нас визначає свій вибір
Цей вибір є втіленням власне свободи
А там де свобода, вилазять уроди
Торгують їблом, надіваючи маски
І в якості смазки розказують сказки
«От я ахуєнний, так шо не пиздіть
І слухайте як вам усім треба жить»
І ділять суспільство на них і на нас
От є такі люди, шо не їдять м'яса
І є такі люди «Ви не зрозуміли!
М'ясо нада шоб усі, блять, не їли!
Давайте відпустим з відкритих дверей
Усіх індюків, коров і курей!»
Ти думаєш: «Сука, угарний, бля, вєктор
В'єбать по приколу аграрний, блять, сєктор
Сидіть без свиней і дєлать сосальдо
В державі із від'ємним торговим, блять, сальдо»


[Частина II]
Та ладно там м'ясо, похуй те м'ясо
В нас тєма сірйозна, це про підарасів
«Бачиш підараса? Хуяр його зразу!
Це загроза життя української раси!»
А інші їм кажуть: «Ви шо, їбанати?
Усі підараси у Верховній Раді!
Крадуть наші бабки і їм похуй дим
Та з таким керівництвом ми хуй побєдим»
І ти чуєш думки з однієї, з другої
«Та ви підараси!» , «Та ви долбайоби!»
І навіть нормально, все дуже логічно
Є дві різні казки, є протиріччя
Якщо ти не дай бог людина критично мисляча
За день тих протиріч, бля, набиратиметься тисяча
І коли тобі пиздять, ти будеш це викупать
Акцентувати увагу і самого себе паять"

She calls my phone up, but I told her, ""I'm a loner"" (Uh)
But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (Uh)
We hit the highway, one-five-five with my whole foot on the dash
She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash

I waited for my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

The afterparty was on Wilson and 73rd
You got the notion that somebody else was with me first

[Pre-Chorus]
But on my radar, you had some nerve to play hard
You took away my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

I can remember when we walked together
Sharing a love I thought would last forever
Moonlight to show the way so we can follow
Waiting inside her eyes was my tomorrow
Then something changed her mind, her kisses told me
I had no loving arms to hold me

[Chorus]

Lonely is a man without love
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out
Lonely is a man without love
Every day I wake up, then I start to break up
Knowing that it's cloudy above
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out
Lonely is a man without love

I cannot face this world that's fallen down on me
So if you see my girl, please send her home to me
Tell her about my heart that's slowly dying
Say I can't stop myself from crying

Every day I wake up, then I start to break up
Lonely is a man without love
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out
Lonely is a man without love
Every day I wake up, then I start to break up
Knowing that it's cloudy above

When I woke up to your voice note
You told me how you'd been feeling
Let's work it out on the remix
You'd always say, ""Let's go out""
But then I'd cancel last minute
I was so lost in my head
And scared to be in your pictures
'Cause for the last couple years
I've been at war with my body
I tried to starve myself thinner
And then I gained all the weight back
I was trapped in the hatred
And your life seemed so awesome
I never thought for a second
My voice was in your head
""Girl, you walk like a bitch""
When I was ten, someone said that
And it's just self-defence
Until you're building a weapon
She believed my projection
And now I totally get it
Forgot that inside the icon
There's still a young girl from Essex


[Pre-Chorus: Charli xcx & Lorde, Lorde]
People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
It's you and me on the coin
The industry loves to spend
And when we put this to bed
The internet will go crazy
I'm glad I know how you feel
'Cause I ride for you, Charli (Charli, Charli)

I was raised outside
In the street wit real niggas
Strapped up wit new bauds and Hilfiger
Would've never figured
My uncle get locked up
For life in the pen
Doin what, pulling triggers
That's why I keep all of my dawgs close
Kibbles and bits Clicquot when we toast
If I found that you doing dirt get hurt
And touch the turf then yo ass is toast


[Pre-Chorus]
Bake it up and split the patty pie
Gotta stay together can't divide
Enemy is waiting on demise
I can see the hate up in dem eyes
Young brothers, sisters on the rise
Gotta keep yo eyes up on the prize
Run it up even when you tired
Never let a hater see you cry

Bilmem gereken bir şey söyle
Sonra nefesimi al ve asla bırakma
Eğer alanını işgal etmeme izin verirsen
Acıyla birlikte, bundan zevk alacağım

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Ve eğer o anda, hazzı yaşarsam*
Bebeğim, o anda, bunun bizden daha büyük bir şey olduğunu
Ve mutluluğun ötesinde olduğunu anlayacaksın
Buna inanmam için bana bir sebep ver

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Çünkü benimle olmak istiyorsan
Beni daha çok, çok, daha çok
Daha çok sevmelisin
Ve eğer bana gerçekten ihtiyacın varsa
Beni daha çok, çok, daha çok
Daha çok sеvmelisin (Da-daha çok sevmelisin)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Daha çok, daha çok, daha çok
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Sеv beni, sev beni, sev beni

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Senin nedenlerini biliyorum ve sen de benimkileri biliyorsun
Beni sevenleri geride bırakma eğilimindeyim
Eğer beni tanıyor ve kalmayı seçiyorsan
O halde bu zevki hisset ve acıyla buna katlan


[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ve eğer o anda azarsan
Seni inlettiğimde, bunun gerçek olduğunu biliyorsun
Kalçalarının arasındaki baskıyı hissedebiliyor musun?
İlk seferinmiş gibi hissettireceğim

With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof

But you don't wanna call it love
You only wanna be the one that I call ""baby""

When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife

You're standing face to face with ""I told you so""
You know I hate to say, I told you so
You know I hate to say, but I told you so

Now you suck
We wanna talk about sex, but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it, but you'd better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
Boy, you're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Now, what's on your nasty old mind?

[Verse 1: TV Girl]
So how should I begin this?
I guess it started when you were with him
And how he never even took you out to dance
But did he fuck with any rhythm?
But now he's playing with your head
But did he ever make you cum?
Did he ever make you cry?
Do the wires in your mind get sewn together?
Rubbed and severed by the heat
You don't know how long I could stare into your picture
And wish that it was me
I guess it's different 'cause you love him
But I've got an interactive
Sick and twisted imagination
And that's gotta count for something

[Chorus: Yeastie Girlz]
We wanna talk about sex, but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it, but you'd better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
Boy, you're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Get your face between my thighs


[Verse 2: TV Girl]
I dreamt I was standing in your doorstep
Licking sweat off of your forehead
With your finger in my mouth
And the sound when leather jackets hit the ground
You should hear when you're not around
When it's just us horny poets
Who can't wait to write it down
And swear we were only being honest
Do you like these little sonnets?
'Cause I wrote them just for you
But how quickly they turn sour
So be careful who you screw
And never call
And I'm starting to suspect
You don't intend to do anything you say at all

[Chorus: Yeastie Girlz]
We wanna talk about sex, but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it, but you'd better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
Boy, you're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Now, what's on your nasty old mind?

Hide here, confide here so we can be broken open

We can fall away, slip out of sight

[Verse 1]
I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave

'Cause it was always you (Alright)
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby

Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better

And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I

'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die

How you look to me, hm
You wouldn't believe if I told ya
You would keep the compliments I throw ya
But you're so full of shit, uh
Tell me it's a bit, oh
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
Don't wanna say goodbye

Getting to my wealth is getting to my health
Couldn't be myself for long
Getting to my wealth, everything that’s right
Everything that's right is wrong
As an animal, programmed or it's not programmed
There’s a gun in the small of my back
An itch you can't scratch that takes me all
Takes me all over the world

[Chorus]
Gets me thrown around
Gets me thrown around
(Gets me thrown around)
(Gets you thrown around)

[Post-Chorus]
(Around, around, around)

I live for a call back
History loves to rhyme
So I look to the past
For everything lasting


[Chorus]
Gets me thrown around
Gets me thrown around

[Post-Chorus]
(Around, around, around, around)
(Around, around, around, around)

[Verse 3]
It's an itch that Nietzsche can't reach
The vicar can't preach
The guru can't teach, it's all at my feet
The need to be seen is turning us green
I find and they keep, they're living my dream
I live on my screen, they’re skimming my cream
But they take me all over the world

[Bridge]
Thrown around

[Chorus]
Gets me thrown around
Gets me thrown around

[Verse 4]
I’m familiar like the cold
Like a bursting pipe
Like a bar fight
I'm familiar like a late train
Like the sentiment of a film
I’ve seen again and again
And again and again in my mind
In my mind"

[Куплет]
Бачу критиків — я ними нехтую
Їх думку можна взяти напрокат
Важко втриматись перед брюнеткою
Вона впливає на мій смак в жінках
Ядовитий стиль, я видихаю дим
Ти добре знаєш: він мені чужий
Поновити змісти моїх парадигм
Про пейзаж наших взаємодій
У нас обох є спільне:
Кубки, медалі, статуетки
Подібне тягне до подібного —
Це закони Всесвіту

[Приспів]
Як я хрипучим голосом казав
Що твої груди — неземна краса
Твій одяг молить, щоб його хтось зняв
Ти знову хочеш, щоби це був я?
Влучила в слабкі місця
Бо в мені ніколи не вщухне азарт
Вдавати холод — це не той варіант
Бо моїй душі потрібен твій бальзам
Як я хрипучим голосом казав
Що твої груди — неземна краса
Твій одяг молить, щоб його хтось зняв
Ти знову хочеш, щоби це був я?
Влучила в слабкі місця
Бо в мені ніколи не вщухне азарт
Вдавати холод — це не той варіант
Бо моїй душі потрібен твій бальзам"

Повільне плавлення, візьму тебе о другій
Рухи вражають, тонкі, ніби лезо, звуки

Холодний розум тепліє від поцілунків
Солоні сльози — справді я тебе розчулив?

Віскі в смітник, бо вийдуть перемовини
Від плинтуса до цифри, що не вміститься у голову
Зношу діалог, роблю жертви задля творчості
Спалив човни, але на спогад є скріншот
Її ноги розійшлися, як квитки на мої шоу
Не відчував зовсім нічого, схоже на больовий шок
А поки моя Соня спить, я ледве себе знайшов
Вдень я зібраний — вночі складаюсь по частинам
Тріп без сітера, як я без її тихих вдихів
Емоції на графік, психологічне насилля
Baby, в нас тут вакханалія, і я не про квартиру
Отримати від іншої щось вище, аніж тіло
Як побачити мене у клубі, майже неможливо
Мені не йде прізвисько сутенер

Smells so sweet 'til they hit the ground

'Cause the wind might come, blow them all away
And there's orange blossoms in the air right now

[Verse 1]
The deeper I go the more I find
Am I just fruit here on this vine
Falling perfectly in time today?
Or did I fall too deep in my metaphor?
'Cause I can't think of anything I wanted more
Than to see the colours of my seasons change

She's always laughing as she turns to leave

547,ШОКАЛО,NORD DIVISION,"2 ContributorsШОКАЛО (SHOKALO) Lyrics[Куплет 1: Петрик]
Череп каже писати краще на світанку
І я писав би годині о 4.20 ранку
Мені ці цифри близькі ще змалку
Ще коли метал ходили красти на свалку чи звалище
Оце так явище
З першого класу називали пропащим
Ніколи не був ледащем
В сьомому класі порізали тіпа
Прийшов з папашей до школи
Дитяча кімната міліції та протоколи
Після уроків знову осідали смоли
Тоді тільки юпі, ніякої коли
Підкатані джинси почав носити відколи
Коли побачив як в'єтнамця закололи
Потім трансформація до околофутболу
Бійка з дніпрянами біля школи
Виїзд, алкоголь, гуділи бджоли
Я завжди був фартовий
А ти з війни зійшов, бо не був готовий
Бо тебе мама народила для любові
Бабулі криють матом 5-поверховим
І називають 6-вольтовим
А ми копаємо окоп під деревом сосновим
ТГК змішується із димом тьотюновим
Злочинний наказ не є обов'язковим
Контрнаступ назвали хрестовим
Валькирії чекають тих, хто не повернеться додому
І вічна пам'ять від Сяну до Дону
Повернемо все обов'язково
Вмикайте на репіт магнітофон
Приїду в Одесу, піду на Ланжерон
Там за воїнів знову марафон
Не так війна перемагається, камон
Пса звали Джека, не Барон
Для всіх, хто сховався заготовлений патрон
До зустрічі, бубон, твій будиночок складе як картон
А Чіткий поїде міністром в Пентагон
Взяв автомат, покинув октагон
Це справжній чоловік, а ти гандон
За правду пардон


[Куплет 2: Череп]
Привід до міліції, у дитинстві
За те що каміннями кидали у лобове скло автобуса
Вже тоді я розумів, що потрібно бути у тонусі
Спочатку прийшли додому, потім повели до гому
Зараз того будинка нема, туди влучила бомба
Шмаляли по ходу по старим картам
Там давно нема мусорів, лише бібліотека
Скільки людей під завалами, а вам всё потеха
Коли би я не їхав, там фотосесія
Наталії Ужвій, 82
Блогер моя професія
А як на війноньку - не хочу
Не син я, а донька
Циганка золоте долоньку
В шкафу церебонькою
Мама не пускає на війну, та навіть на вулицю
А вдруг повістку дадуть під під'їздом
Квохчу прям як куриця. Чи квочка?
В мене, брат, хворі почки. Чи нирки?
Ви, сука, утирки
Ваш батя кончив в пробірки
І замість горщика ви сіли на бутилки
Летять опілки, прошило так
Що в генераторі дирки
Від повістки ти уїхав аж до обтирки
Це огидно. Не ведіть себе як бидло
В паспорті - українець, так значить будь гідним
Це наша сторінка історії
Я в кожному куплеті це кажу
Чекай мене, Євпаторія
Ми будемо курити за санаторіями
Така наша доля
А ти як бздо від фасолі. Чи канкерне
Фу, сука. Яке ж ти дурне, блять
Яке ж ти дурне


[Куплет 3: Чіткий]
В час військового стану, яке нахуй fight company?
Вітання зобов'язаним від комітету військового
До самого Шокола
Як тобі сніданок зі смачного телескопа?
Голова пропідарськи налаштована
З'їбалась, коли припекло?
У лютому-лютому було
Нацик за новим тримає на виході метро ""Ботанічний сад""
Ну шо ти, тигр, як сам?
З посадки на посаду, засада в районі посаду
Дружба ваша сирок буде смоктати
Позаштатний не зрозумів ці чудеса
До Кривого Томаса летить три плюса
Битися не в тренді, особливо тим, хто розуміє
Геєнна гієні, людина людині
Ви були на вахті, чи темки мутили?
Мабуть, тукру в грузаках возили
Поки навиками виживання нас нагородили
Задумайся, ворог, чому так дорого те, що було
Й те, що з самого дитинства засіло у голову?
Grand Champ, п'ятий студійний альбом
Get It On The Floor
Перевіримо, чи витримає пенальті з наскоку
Вестибулярний у нормі, неусвідомлене володіння джоулями
Що там по спорту, гноми? Накладення турнікета терміново
На шиї затягнутий кет
Немає для нас авторитетів
На пляшку і синьку просила пара атлетів
Олексій, очі поставте. Приліт на концерті важкої атлетики
Москва під натиском потребує знищення купки абреків
Тремтять руки поліцейського. Віддає квиток разом з честю. Натівський квиток вписано декілька
Відірваний голові не допоможе турнікет


[Куплет 4: Окопний Джо]
Вогонь горить, а кров ллється
Загибель побратимів - тяжка трагедія
Помста за неї готується. Нікого не менеться
Зброя завжди напоготові
Всіх у бій, kick-door
Получи свінця в голову. Підор в упор
Рейди та розвідка втомлюють нас. Ага, щас
Штурмовок і в окопах трупним ядом
Двухсотих, сука, давлять масовкою
Затягаємо монти
Смерть повсюди, але ми її не боїмося
Вистоїмо та помстимося
Захід сонця нам не дає відпочинку прокачає seal skill
Тільки з димом. Туман війни в нашому серці
Запах пороху забиває нам дихання
Бої в місті. Кров на бетоні
Сотні тисяч патронів в картоні на полігоні
Відвага нас не залишає в бою
Павші воїни завжди в строю
Грязюка Донбасу з'їсть твою екіпу
Мультіками лови. Підрив на броні
Відкинуло вліво. Пощастило. Неначе цілий
Тепловізор показує ворога у вікні
Пізда, грушні, русні. А ми воюємо
Війна свободи. Наші серця б'ються за людське життя
Жагою до перемоги
Увага! Увага! Арта їбана виходить з рівноваги
День за днем
Відбиваємо те, що нам коштує. Занадто дорого
Захід сонця над нами. І ми не здатні зупинитися
Війна це реальність. І нам не спиться
Чи нам це не сниться? Йоу!
Продовжуємо борьбу за мир та волю
Не станемо на коліна перед ворогом
В чистому полі, бо ми воюємо за сонце в небі
І землю під ногами
Хай вогонь горить
Хай кров л'ється. Життя перед очима пронесеться
Ми не здаємося
Продовжуємо йти на пролом
Шторм. Борьба за справедливість і правду
Наша мета. Лава плавить метал
Ти в кармані тримаєш портрети дому
Не здолати тебе нікому. Ми здобудемо перемогу
Бо ми правдиві герої цієї історії

[Куплет 5: Мосін]
Я знаю, що на мої слова багато хто ображається
Я всього лише кажу правду
Оскільки війна не зупиняється
Ти нічого не зробив задля перемоги
Тим паче якщо ти не знав, козаче
Під час війни біля ""П'яної Вишні"" знаходяться тільки п'яниці
Агов, батьки, уважніше слідкуйте за своїми дітьми
АЗОВ 12-та бригада НГУ захищає Кременські ліси
Якщо ми помремо, вам потрібно буде весь цей тягар нести
Російська федерація в Харкові -
Не допоможуть навіть хрести
Час назад не відмотати, нікого вже не спасти
Валерій Федорович, чому у нас до сих пір не всі люди на війні? Нашо воно розважається, як начебто в розважальному
Таборі
Половина військових на цвинтарі, інші - контужені або поранені
Тим паче багато хто з українців втратив на війні майже піврідні. Наприкінці весни до контрнаступу рахував лічені дні
Оскільки особисто мені дуже кортілося піти на прорив
І вписати кров'ю своє ім'я в ці історичні часи
І ось почалося, очікуємо контрнаступу, про який кожен мріяв у весні
Бойові дії за моєю оцінкою не рухаються нікуди
Ні тобі, ні мені, ні туди, ні сюди
Фронт став, та й стоїть. Дрон завис над головою
Вистріли в проному два рожки
Було незрозуміло, чи він скине скіф, чи то був FPV
Горіло все на світі від посадок до будь-якої броні
На півдні України в ті часи йшли надважкі бої
Мати тримала за мене кулаки на питання: ""як справи, сину?""
Відповідав: ""мама все, як завжди""
Поки озброєні псевдоватажки розважали дівчат
Вигулюючи їх через закордонні стежки
Будьте обережні, хлопці, там заміновані усюди стежки
Ми вчора особисто там були з Ромчиком із ФБФі
Все поле в темках, а по боках стоять підірвані бредлі
Якщо зайдете в глибину посадки, там можуть бути помки або ОЗМки
Шість гелікоптерів в нашому секторі працювало в парі
Нурсами вони нас завжди посипали навіть крізь хмари
Зате я знаю причину, по якій ми їх не збивали
Оскільки ЗСУшники, як завжди, в бліндажі п'яні спали
Що з ними трапилося далі, історія замовчує ці деталі
Життя завжди карає, якщо ви, люди недбалі
Кирило Баєв вбитий 14 січня поблизу Соледара
Вічна шана тобі, брате, на шлях вольно не кожен міг стати
Тому продовжуємо нести свій військовий стяг надалі
Поки не займемо своє почесне місце на п'єдесталі
Будь ласка, врятуйте хто-небудь полонених за Азовсталі
Мені здається, всі стали забувати, що їх життя ще чогось варте
В житті не існує жодних вигаданих правил моралі
Це все придумали люди, щоб вони могли міцніше спати ночами. Існує думка, що футбольні хулігани дуже зухвалі
Влаштовують фестивалі і бійки короткотривалі
На війні не за медалі, хоча не знаєм, що буде далі
Товаришу полковник, а ваші діти воювали?
Українські повстанці в боях ніколи не відступають
Кохання живе три роки. Добре, а скільки тоді війна триває?
По новинах в телемарафоні ми, як завжди, перемагаєм
Це було б гарно, проте ситуація далека до реалій
Тобі не вистачає справжних чоловічих баталій
Оскільки жодного разу ти не ходив на штурм разом з нами
Не стріляв разом з нами, не ховався від обстрілу разом з нами
Не плакав разом з нами та не сміявся разом з нами
Війна триває далі, зупини її в Інстаграмі
Який пост ти б не писав, це нічого не рішає
2024 рік, нова війна в новому році
Зрадники і зрадниці продовжують життя на кожному кроці
Не перевіряй кишені, он вони йдуть по дорозі
Загиблі воїни потрапляють в вічність
У матері залишаються тільки лише сльози
Можновладці не можуть відшукати правду в протиріччях
Мене оточують люди, але важливо зрозуміти, хто вони
Я нічого не чекаю, друже, чого раджу і тобі
Життя військового страшніше, ніж в хорорі
В цій боротьбі що хочеш, то й роби
Проте найважливішим є не брехати самому собі
Звичайний збіг обставин чи ні?
В Україні не вистачає молоді, проте вистачає гробів
Наша кров прадідівська, і вона теж горить
Революція гідності -  золоті дні, революція наша, проте слова не мої
Багато воїнів було вбито в бахмутській різні
Чому місто не готували до оборони генерали та високі чини? Жодних рівнів захисту, системи окопів різної глибини
Піхотинці окопувалися під ворожими обстрілами арти
В той час по телемарафону, навіть коли наші війська відійшли
Ми перемагали незупинно
Пропаганда на рівні Гебельса навіть не проси
Додавала краси ситуація з цивільними людьми
Байдужі повірять, оскільки так сказали по TV
Проте рівень бажаючих піти в армію знизився до рекордного мінімуму з початку повномасштабної війни
Громадянина України не затягнути туди як не крути
Два роки війни, два роки перемагаємо, проте так і не перемогли
В громадському полі вирують настрої на мирні перемовини
У кого що в нас запитай, всім дуже важко, і всі вони не готові
З давних-давен для перемоги в великих битвах потрібно втратити багато крові
Політика, геополітика - велика сила
Цілі країн-агресорів завжди дуже суворі
Це все можна легко зрозуміти, якщо окунутись глибше в історію
Проти нас воює країна чмобіків, так кажуть нашій аудиторії. Кількість загиблих українських героїв досі невідома
СМІ та будь-які журналісти тримають це питання
Під контролем
На жаль, країна у нас на весь світ відома, а люди в ній не свідомі
Що буде далі – це гарне питання
Подивіться на кількість захвачених ворогом територій
Їх ніхто не віддасть без бою, навіть якщо ти будеш знати секретні паролі
Держава не працює, поки не працюєш ти
Це, скоріше, правило, а не аксіома
Громадяни перекладають свою безвідповідальність на військових
І так все знову йде по колу, нічого не відбувається
Все стоїть на своїх місцях
Прийде наш час, ми поставимо переможний стяг
Ті, хто не воювали і приїжджають додому в Україну
Завжди пам'ятайте, віднині ви не вдома, а навіки в гостях
На початку повномасштабного вторгнення війну зупинили звичайні люди
А не політики та генерали, які кинули людей як бездомних собак
А ти – звичайний сикливий хробак

[Куплет 6: Молодий]
На нашем роду написано:
Если воевать, то как мужчина с большими рисками
Если штурмовать, то только в Instagram-Reels'ах
Если вызвали на войну
А от вашей бандейки за всю БР-ку нету смысла
Поля выводят эскизы
Добавляют краски в жизни
Градина, встрявшая в машину
У меня не вызвала нервоз и плохие мысли
Володя ведь за рулем, а не Мыся
Надуманные бежали довольно таки быстро
Волонтеркой, снесенной с дизельной
Накормили мышей
Ларпак во время кампании Молодого
Выступил с крысиной идеей
Операция длится две недели, небыстро
На календаре дни миновали
В блокнотах записи орудий листы списывали
За ночную смену больше ста минометных выстрелов
Прочти, что на блоках написано
Werning to hell, дорога крутит на пальце жизни
Крики ""сваливаем быстро""
Пищит рация от недостатка заряда
Душит летом снаряга
На энтузиазме страну защищать пошел во благо
Тревожит свежая порция КАБов
Взрывы там, куда нам надо
За мотолыгой целый день гонялся грустный
По подвалам скитался
Планы, раздумья с утра по новой врываться
Выманить, посадить на АТшку
Чтоб на перекресток больше не сувался
Танчик сутками по нашему дому разряжался
А ты говорил войны нету, пора просыпаться
Мы на войне в ритме танцев
Музыка дает расслабляться
После прилета очередной кассеты
Выгорает лесополоса
В ушах гудит хуета
По пидорам разряжай все, что можно
В любое время года
Провести диверсию в тылу поможет только погода
Заряжай, взрывай, стреляй
На войне нам все можно
А что ты там, блять, скажешь, сапожник?

[Куплет 7: Радік]
Ти не можеш розгледіти через лупу свою залупу
Сука, дивлюсь та дивуюсь, як малюють безрукі
У сусідній посадці чутно сердець стуки
Бо хуярить той, що сонце пече
Комусь на плече, на тім живе тіло
Комусь зрачок і особистого воділу
Буває, наче людина смілива, а ТЦК-шніку дає в рило
Ми ГУРівці, сука. Буває, двояка людина, наче і не воював
А в сторіз щоденно закликає до служби
Ніякої дружби з цивілом
Сам посміхається, дядькам в кожанках
Ні-ні-ні, це все в рамках
Загорілася зброя, бам, постріл в коліна
Грався з ТТ, завалив побратима
Взимку в сторіз взагалі лавина
Тому що зимою я стабільно трьохсота людина
Вілкула на віла, ломом в могилу
Відпрацювали з ""Шмеля"" в нікуда
Відпрацювали з усього
Туда операція під назвою «Діра»
Поміняв сім турнікетів ТрО-шникам в пакеті над FIMO 90
Ящик кефок і піндосівську муху
В мене всередині розірване вухо
А ти, сука, сиди і слухай
Як люди живуть і кайфують
Ділять на трьох підарячий сухпай
Галету ламаю, з танчика прилітає
Прижався до Тошика, наче хочу вдути
Так близько не тулився на бороді і до батуту
Що не вихід, усі прильоти - мої
В Барса тепер немає ноги
Розʼїбе кумовство у тобі
Загоються рани, буду жить десь на війні
Стріляти баранів. А як помру, то поховайте мене в Кривому Розі
Біля шахти на дорозі, сука
Там мені і воля, там мені і смерть
Жартую, в Києві спаліть, половину - скуріть
Похую, воюю задля забави
Перед бойовою квизда з уставом
Батя учил устав
Это вам не танком в канал, канал кровавых пятен
И ты просить устал.Учиться было кстати
Почему ты не в армии, пидор?
Приеду покрошу тебя через гриндер
Пользы будет мало, удовольствия - навалом
Назову вас всех шакалами, ебаные шмары
У вас ума, как у мамонта. Сидим-пердим, плюем
Бью Сталина. Забахмутка в сердце оставила рану
И рука пострадала. Крошили за нас ублюдков навалом
Главное — это стабильность, и ты стабильно вымрешь
Словно племя майя
У нас пластинка другая: режем русню, запиваем чаем
Наши жены служат вместе с нами
Друг другу помогаем
Живем жизнь как не последнюю, а как крайнюю
У половины - ордена и медали
Кому-то айфончик дали, кому-то нихуя
А потом догнали, еще раз нихуя не дали
После боячки разбираем тела и дедали, моем педали
Чистим стволы, травим мышей
Ходим по селам в сандалях
Дроны — тупик войны, нахуй вы их создали?
Бизона уграли
Снился, передавал привет Молдавану
Но он же не знает
Сука, передавал привет Молдавану
Но он же не знает
Передавали Азову танковые дымы за пару грамм шмали
Шмотки Покруч-team, только тем, кто трехсотился
Будем высылать, учить людей, жить с войной в голове
Не ходить во снах на нуле
Щастя від війни є
Жага крові та помсти
Списки загиблих друзів тільки в 3D
Тому що очі на мокрому місці
Це як я, коли у лікарні кришу зірвало
Від СМС щодо загибелі тих самих танкістів, що дими надавали
Починаєш згадувати кожного
В тебе тремор по тілу
Сльози рікою, дезорієнтація
Встав, впав єбалом в підлогу
Санітари провели, підійнали
Сука, сил на вас немає. Підори русняві
Тут shadow терикон називаються братами
Донецький двіж як не знали
Також убивали, стріляли, у пастки попадали
Касетки на себе приймали
По сорок мін без навушників на помсту
Кент навчився використовувати мзду
Половина після ПТУ розумніша за тих
Що називають роботою похід в Раду
Їх всіх до параду прайду. Воювать не пойду
Бояться за себе і свою бестолкову голову
А ми воюємо з думками за сім'ю
Кожен вихід омиваємо кров'ю
Розосередились в яру
На нас набули СПГ
Лисий, Лисий, прийом, на зв'язку
Витягли Хантера та Грома
Конями його зірвали з медрюкзаку
Він побачив більше за всю країну
Мальчиків з пальчиків
Маю на увазі тих, що за мір то кричать
Хто поможе ЗСУ? Дзюдо на базі
Тренує вбивати мразєй
Прильот в восьми метрах всі на увазі
Прискорилися АГСу прилетіло в щоку
Не заслужив на відпустку недовгу
Хотілося б в ногу
Щоб просто не бачити сліди крові п'ятен на дорозі
Страйкбол в змозі отримати з вінтореза в голову
Атлєта броня прикриває. Тільки не руки, тю, тільки не руки
Знову прилетіло і все ж таки в руку
Заїбали, падлюки, ми воюємо в кайф
На відміну від вас, недолугі
Нам не треба ні визнання, ні недуги
Упор лёжа, так понятна, суки?"

Sure, it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion
But I don't need the comfort of any lies
For I have seen the ending and there is no ascending rise
Oh, back when I was younger, was told by other youngsters
That my end will be torture beneath the earth
'Cause I don't see what they see when death is staring at me
I see a window, a limit, to live it, or not at all

Would your life even matter anymore?

But there's this momentary beam of light
You don't have to wait those salty decades
To get through the gate, it's all in front of your face
I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
But there's this momentary beam of light

I could-could cross the ocean in a fit of devotion (I'm sure there won't always be sunshine)
For every shining second this fragile body beckons (But there's this momentary beam of light)

We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch
We joked as we looked that they were too good for us

With runaway fathers and mothers who drank

And now I know, now I know
It's time to go, it's time to go

From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you
But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew
I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love
You said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us
The only mistake that we didn't make was run

Et nos mains qui tremblent au vent
Comme des biguines aux pas légers
Continueront de battre le temps
Sous des soleils endimanchés

Des bégonias sur le balcon
Un petit air de calypso
Photos sépias dans le salon
Malgré la vie le temps passé
Malgré la jeunesse fatiguée
Personne ne pourra empêcher
Nos corps usés de chalouper

Avant qu’le printemps s’fasse automne
Que l’on s’éloigne de la rive
On scratchera du gramophone
Quelques ritournelles caraïbes
On s’épuisera sur le dancefloor
En de petits pas économes
Tant que sera levé le store
Nos palpitants s’ront métronomes
Elles me reviennent les années folles
Quand on mourrait seulement de rire
Oh, rappelle-toi du Malecón
Le clapotis de nos souvenirs
Un jour viendra cette ritournelle
Quand ma voix se s’ra envolée
Je te supplie en souvenir d’elle
De continuer à chalouper

İki şarap daha istedim çünkü bu gece onu istiyorum

[Bölüm 1: RAYE]
Eğer umurunda olacaksa sana olaydan biraz bahsedeyim
Kendimi berbat bir durumun içinde buluyorum
Sevdiğim adam geçen gece beni karşısına oturttu
Ve bana her şeyin bittiğini söyledi, aptalca bir karar
Ve ben kalbimin nasıl parçalandığını hissetmek istemiyorum
Aslında, hissetmek istemiyorum, bu yüzden içmeye devam ediyorum
Ve ben bugün basit bir görevle şehirdeyim
Küçük siyah elbisemin içinde, üstüme de baya bir oturuyor

A room at dusk
Mastering the art of lying still
Breathe like a girl
'Til my lungs fill

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, pull your boots up, boys
And push me down
I'm only here
For your entertainment

[Chorus]
I am a dark red liver stretched out on the rocks
All the poison, I convert it and I turn it to love
Here comes the feminine urge, I know it so well
To nurture the wounds my mother held

[Verse 2]
Oh ballerina, bend under the weight of it all
Ain't it fun to hold the world in your hands?
Do you feel like a man when I can't talk back?
Do you want me, or do you want control?
Failure to commit to the role, I admit
Was a failure you achieved on your own
Do you want me to care when you just disappear?
I can't win them all (I can't win them all)


[Pre-Chorus]
Run 'til I fall
How I wish the trees would swallow me
Make me a forest
Take away my soul
I could never give the curse to her
I, I could never live with the guilt of lying
That people are kind

[Chorus]
I am a dark red liver stretched out on the rocks
All the poison, I convert it and I turn it to love
Here comes the feminine urge, I know it so well
To nurture the wounds my mother held

[Post-Chorus]
Oh ballerina, bend under the weight of it all
Ain't it fun to hold the world in your hands?
Do you feel like a man when I can't talk back?
Do you want me or do you want control?
Failure to commit to the role, I admit
Was a failure you achieved on your own
Do you want me to care when you just disappear?
I can't win them all (I can't win them all)

I am a dark red liver (Ooh) stretched out on the rocks (Oh-oh-ooh)
All the poison, I convert it and I turn it to love (Ooh-oh-ooh-ooh)
Here comes the feminine urge, I know it so well (Oh-oh-ooh)
To nurture the wounds my mother held

Give me that dark red liquor stretched out on the rocks

Don't you just love
To kill the light in my eyes
To make me low when I’m high
Oh-woah, oh (It's just a, it's just a)
""It’s just a joke""
You always say afterwards
Still my feelings get hurt
Oh-woah, oh

Don't say I'm too much
That I'm over the top
You don't understand me
We're so different at heart
You're on Earth, I'm on Mars, ah-ah

All I ever wanted was your love
I toned myself down for you
Volume one, almost mute
I’ll never ignite
You always found a way to bring me down
You trivialised everything
From my tears to my grins
Oh-woah, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
It’s like you're scared of anything real (What?)
For a second I thought you were sincere (What?)
But you’ve been dragging me down all of these years (What?)
With your coldness, and I don't care

You go through life like you're on, on a—
You go through life like you're on a fucking runway
Dracula shoulders, they be blockin' all my sunrays
This throwin' shade is so passé
Forever is unlikely for us
Opposites attract, odds are more like Blackjack
House always wins, so I'm taking all my love back
With you, I lose either way

[Pre-Chorus]
You think I'm weird when I get too excited (What?)
I think it's weird how you're so empty-minded (What?)
Yeah, you've been dragging me down all of these years (What?)
With your coolness, and I don't care

Don't say I'm too much

You don't understand me

It's been rainin' since you left me, now I'm drownin' in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter, but without you, I give up

I can't sing a love song like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore, but baby, that's just me

Now your pictures that you left behind are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry, one that made you have to say goodbye

Never been one to trust
Never saw the gain in lust
It's all too real when the love you feel is forgotten
When another lays in the bed you made
And your best days are forgotten
Is he all you need?
Do you look at him the same way you looked at me?
You looked at me

[Chorus]
'Cause when you say that I'm the only one
Did you mean that I'm the closest one around?
Around
You know that talk is cheap and don't mean a thing
Did you say you loved me 'cause you liked the way it sounds?

It sounds now, darling, the past it hurts
But thе future ain't got nothing to do with you

Fools
Now, I know so much better, babe
Than to go around feeding snakes like you

Everybody wrestles with their demons
But who would've known the devil I chose
She's an angel when she's sleeping
Sweet legion, release me
The Devil in Heaven was still God's favorite

Is it a sign that I haven't slept in weeks?
The sun it shines
And it's so bright in my eyes
But I still cannot see

And it's half pastime you leave

Did you mean that I'm the closest one around?

I'm goin' down to the railway station, gonna get a ticket to ride
Find a big fat lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
Tryin' to hide my sorrow from the people I meet

[Verse 1]
And get along with it all
Go down where the people say ""y'all""
Sing a song with a friend
Change the shape that I'm in
And get back in the game
And start playin' again

[Verse 2]
I'd like to stay but I might have to go to start over again
Might go back down to Texas or might go to somewhere that I've never been
And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
And I won't have to go home
Get used to bein' alone
Change the words to this song
And start singin' again

[Verse 3]
I'm tired of runnin' 'round lookin' for answers to questions that I already know
I could build me a castle of memories just to have somewhere to go
Count the days and the nights that it takes to get back in the saddle again
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day
Start talkin' again, when I know what to say

I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station, gonna get a ticket to ride
Find a big fat lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times

Tryin' to hide my sorrow from the people I meet
And get along with it all

I asked you a question, I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Yeah, I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a–Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)
I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Yeah, I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a–Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)

[Verse 1: Brad Petering, Roxanne Shanté]
I heard that you heard
That I was writing songs about you
That I was bad mouthing your name
In some shitty bar somewhere
You know how I love these biased, one-sided conversations
So let's discuss the whos, the whys, the whens, the hows, the wheres
But who really cares?
If it was all in my mind  (And you don't know why)
If it was all in my mind  (And you don't know why)
To begin with  (And you don't know why)
(Keep the chaos 'cause you don't know why)
If it was all in my mind  (And you don't know why)
If it was all in my mind (And you don't know why)
To begin with  (And you don't know why)
(Keep the chaos 'cause you don't know why)

Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)

Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a–Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)

[Verse 2: Brad Petering, Roxanne Shanté]
And I remember her bent over
And knowing that it was the last time
You know the end is near
If she only lets you fuck at night
And when she finally came even though she faked it
It was much appreciated
At least she had the decency
To try to make a sound that she thought I'd like
But it's alright
'Cause it was all in my mind (And you don't know why)
'Cause it was all in my mind (And you don't know why)
To begin with (And you don't know why)

Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a–Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)

[Verse 3: Maddie Acid,  Roxanne Shanté]
Yeah, I heard your song but I wasn't impressed
So, you got your feels hurt and now you're feeling depressed
Just because we had sex and it didn't last?
Now you want revenge, you wanna put me on blast?
Don't make me laugh, remember all those girls you played
With all the lies you told back in the day to get laid?
An excuse for Suzie, you got a story for Lori
And all those other girls you only called when you were horny  (Have to make a–Why'd you have to make a–)
So yeah, it's nothing that you didn't do first
The only difference is that you probably did it worse
So look at the big bad soldier
Declaring holy war on every girl who didn't mean to fuck him over
But karma's a bitch for hypocrites who kiss and tell
And talk shit about girls who only wished him well
So if you wanna chat, just stick to the facts and get at me
From Russia with love, Maddie


[Outro: Roxanne Shanté]
(And you don't know why, and you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a–
Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a–
Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a–
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)

She know that it's right here for her
I wanna see her break it down (Yeah)
I'm ballin', throwing money 'round

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
She a working girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She fine as hell, she 'bout the dough
She doing her thing out on the floor
Her money-money, she make it, make it
Look at the way she shake it, shake it
Make you wanna touch it, make you wanna taste it
Have you lusting for it, going crazy, face it
Now don't stop, get it, get it
The way she shake it make you wanna hit it
Think she double-jointed from the way she split it
Got your head fucked up from the way she did it
She so much more than you used to
She know just how to move to seduce you
She gon' do the right thing and touch the right spots
And dance in your lap 'til you ready to pop


[Bridge: 50 Cent & Justin Timberlake; Justin Timberlake]
She always ready, when you want it, she want it
Like a nympho, the info, I'll show you where to meet her
On the late night, 'til daylight, the club jumping
If you want a good time, she gon' give you what you want
Let me talk to you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, you're so new-age, you're like my new craze

Spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You got me saying, ""Ayo!"" I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo! I'm tired of using technology

Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Got a thing for that thing she got
The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that—that there should be 'gainst the law

[Bridge: 50 Cent, 50 Cent & Justin Timberlake; Justin Timberlake]
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I'll do to you
Let's get it poppin', shawty, we could switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
Let me talk to you

Take you by your hand
And tell you that you're good enough

You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it, I still don't know why

You curse my name
In spite, to put me to shame
Air all my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why (Don't know why)

The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from the cup 'till it runneth over, Holy Grail
Uh, Blue told me to remind you niggas
Uh, fuck that shit y'all talkin' about, I'm the nigga
Uh, caught up in all these lights and cameras
Uh, but look what that shit did to Hammer
Uh, goddammit I like it
The bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
30 mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that

Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See them by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
I'm getting high, sittin' low
Sliding by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain works
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with it, this shit ain't work, this light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off of your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours, why you mad take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with that bath water you're still alive
Still that nigga nigga, you survived

Aromatic bark and petrichors of yesterday
A lonely feeling lightly enveils the sun, the color of soil and deep honey
Sweet nectar of a wandering child

As tracing towards a time and place, saw spring flowers
Feeding of rain
Saw the light in her skin
Glistening

Saw the sun become memories
And the orchid veins into soil"

Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh)

You like me best when I’m at my worst
You liked it better when I was smaller
You’re always searching for an opportunity to try and stop us but you won’t

We’re not cynical, it doesn’t matter anymore
What ever it was you thought of me won’t make a difference
We’ll keep pressing on, keep pressing on

So what do you want me to say, we’re here now and here to stay?
We made the most of our mistakes and kept pressing on and on
So say whatever you want, but in the end all we want
Is make the most of our mistakes and press on and on and on

Keep talking, keep keep talking about how my future’s a failure
And how I should doubt every step I take, every move I make
How you laugh at all my mistakes
But I’ll prove you wrong and I’ll move along
You can call me weak, call me anything
Yeah, give me your worst, I’ll come back stronger

So what do you want me to say, we’re here now and here to stay?
We made the most of our mistakes and kept pressing on and on
So say whatever you want, but in the end all we want
Is make the most of our mistakes and press on and on and on


Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, keep pressing on and on

(Derek Sanders)
I never want to look anywhere but straight ahead
It gets hard to see so just close your eyes and I’ll take you there
I know it looks like hell but every obstacles is worth it
Just to prove you’re worth it and keep moving on

So what do you want me to say, we’re here now and here to stay?
We made the most of our mistakes and kept pressing on and on
(And keep moving on)
So say whatever you want, but in the end all we want
Is make the most of our mistakes and press on and on and on
(and keep moving on)

I wrote this song two hours before we met
I didn't know your name or what you looked like yet

I could have gone to see a film instead
You might have changed your mind and seen your friend
Life could have been very different but then
Something changed

[Verse 2]
Do you believe that there's someone up above?
And does he have a timetable directing acts of love?
Why did I write this song on that one day?
Why did you touch my hand and softly say
""Stop asking questions that don't matter anyway
Just give us a kiss to celebrate here today""
Something changed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh, when we woke up that morning we had no way of knowing
That in a matter of hours, we'd change the way we were going
Where would I be now
Where would I be now if we'd never met
Would I be singing this song to someone else instead

Oh, we were born within an hour of each other
Our mothers said we could be sister and brother

And they said that when we grew up
We'd get married and never split up

With woodchip on the wall

I would be living down here on my own
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago

You were the first girl at school to get breasts
And Martyn said that you were the best
Oh, the boys all loved you but I was a mess

Oh, it meant nothing to you

So, what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?
There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your housе
And I hopе this works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know


[Verse 2]
And I'm awarе that you were lying in the gutter
'Cause I did everything to be there by your si-i-ide
So, when you tell me I'm the reason, I just can't believe the lies
And why do I still want to call you? (Call you, call you, call you)

[Chorus]
So, what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?
There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hope this works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know

[Bridge]
Ohh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't know why I'm no one

[Pre-Chorus]
So, get away
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
You know you didn't lose your self-control
Let's start at the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
And let yourself go
Is that a compromise?


[Chorus]
So, what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?
There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hope this works out
But you know how much you broke me apart

Багато
З тобою була дитина
Тепер сива я
Колишу ненародженого сина

А ти ніколи не вернешся додому
Ніколи більш не буде поцілунків у шию
Не знаю, як боротись з цим болем
Я би врятувала тебе, але не вмію
Мені б знов почути твій голос
Який щодня твердив мені:
""Лиш не здавайся""
Я просила б знову і знову:
""Нічого не треба мені, лиш повертайся""

[Куплет 2]
З тобою сміялись часто
Не бувало тривог
Хто ж знав, що так мало часу
Нам залишив Бог
Мало
Який не шукай епітет
Жорстокий режисер
Коли на початку
Головний герой
Помер

I may not be as honest as I ought to be
Now that, when the walls go up
I said it didn't worry me but it hit me like an arrow
Babe, to know, I could just be paranoid
Won't quell the desire to know what was really going on
""Does it really fucking matter, babe?"" is all you can ask me
Okay, fair play, here we go

[Verse 2]
I've heard those words before
Are you sure it was nothing
'Cause it made me feel like dying inside
Never thought I was insecure, but it's pure
Didn't notice until I was in love for real
Am I really gonna cross the line
Just to find what you're typing?
If only I could read your mind
Ooh, I'd be fine, I'd be normal
But now’s my time, gonna do it

[Verse 3]
And suddenly I'm the phony one
The only one with a problem
True love is bringing it out of me
The worst in me, and I know now
Do you remember the time we were
The time we were by the ocean?
I didn't care if it was day or night
The world was right where I wanted

Do you recognize me?
Am I still the boy you saw
In that basement
In that summer?

Are you sure
Of all that we were sure of?
Do you lie awake at night
Wondering who’s this by your side?

And we’ve changed
In one hundred different ways
But my heart still beats the same
It’s coming, coming, coming:
The day when this present pain will fade
When we will be okay
It’s coming, coming, coming

Something borrowed, something blue
Something brokеn now made new
Therе’s a ring around the truth
And I feel it too
When there’s no one else around
What was lost can now be found
In sheets of snow upon the ground


So love
Do you recognize me?
Am I still the boy you saw
In that basement
In that summer?

And we’ve changed
In one hundred different ways
But my heart still beats the same
It’s coming, coming, coming
It’s coming, coming, coming

I hear the notes all bending
There will be time and time and time
For every summer’s ending
For every life you dream at night
Somewhere in deathless darkness
Waits every hope and prayer and plan
Unanswered by the silence —
All our tomorrows on our hands"

Виведу з дому і кину на сходи, коли непривабливо себе ведеш
Де взяв ти манери? З якої панелі? Не попадеш у мій кортеж
На перетині з кретинами лінія штрихпунктир
Обведу ворога крейдою, не треба транспортир
Виграв життя у тир, а шо розкажеш мені ти?
Моє місто звати Q, доп'ю і надягну свій панцир

[Приспів]
Моє місто подарує неприємний сон
Не поможе мізкам твоїм навіть Цитрамон
Моє місто загартує руки під бетон
Живу тут я, живеш тут ти і ше є Libenson

[Verso 1: Iggy Azalea y Tyga]
Uh, abre la caja fuerte, las perras tienen mucho que decir
Un coño en tu cara que te pondrá en tu lugar (boom)
Siete Letras en el plato, te joden en la cabeza (perra)
Tengo autos, tengo bolsas, tengo bienes raíces (el dinero rige-)
Juego erótico, no he venido a jugar
Tengo dinero de peces gordos, él va a morder el cebo
¿Puedes dejarlo caer, hacer que ese culo me hable?
Mantenga esa energía, bébete todo ese Hennessy (culo)
Necesito mi bolso rápidamente
Separados a 6 grados, las perras creen conocerme
Pistolas sexuales, Sid Vicious, lo que quieras es cachondo
Transfiere dinero a mi cuenta, la revisaré mañana
En efectivo; Esta perra esta brillando
Vestida de diseñador, ella podría crecer
Y es el momento perfecto, soñar con Tanny
Bella Hadid, este amigo podría conseguirlo

Los culos gobiernan todo a mi alrededor
Estoy en lo profundo de ese coño, sí, me estoy ahogando
Soy un tiburón en el agua, ¿cómo me encontraste?
El mejor regalo gira en torno de mi  (soy un perro)
Voy a la caza del tesoro (woof)
(El dinero rige-) Sí, hago mis propias reglas
Tatuajes en ese culo, ella lo mueve muy bien
Bienvenido al ""Club de los jugadores"", Ice Cube
Puede que los diamantes sean la noticia
Perra, eso es photoshoop, como los raperos con autotune (dinero)

А, один, два, ага
Та, це реп, блять

[Куплет 1]
«Ти душніла», — саме так мені вчора сказав діагност
Кожен мій пост в Інсті — то дуже великий пост
Я з тих, хто перемиває вже тричі вимитий посуд
Я з тих, хто замість Fake Hostel дрочить на оригінал Босха
Мозок мучить мене, ніби мій мозок робив Мазок
Захєр, мазл тов, але, якщо ти шлємазл, йди нахєр
Не треба волати: «Шухєр», якщо чуєш, шо їде шифер
Ментальна рівновага — то вигадка, чи то Бодо Шефера, чи то Люцифера
Якщо шифер їде, то, може, до тебе приїде Клавдія на Ауді
З формами, як у Гауді, та отворами малими, як в гауді
Головне, бути впевненим у собі, як ті у Верховній Раді клауни
На мені лежать обов’язки, але я помстився і клав на них
Я не бізнес-кит — двічі взяв, тричі дав
Я Джейсон Кід — Містер triple double
Тріп під таблами — моя щоденна екскурсія, одна по ціні двох
Від однієї такої екскурсії Parfeniuk би здох
Бережи гніздо, мий пір’я, тримай яйця міцними
Кукуха та інші птахи відлетіли — біс з ними
Бачив зими у червні, бачив червоні зими
Бачив небо синє, бачив зелені рослини
І повір мені, вони не озимі


[Куплет 2]
Ти знімаєш дівчат на камеру тишком нишком — лох
Я знімаю дівчат разом зі своєю дівчиною
Після ми дихаємо втрьох, стаємо вище
Нас видно одразу, як Івана Франка на Личаківськім кладовищі
Арестович вчив мене пиздіти, Порох — красти
Можу закластись: коли шукаю закладку, я — Коул Расті
Області темряви мої на формули не розкласти
Коли я читаю реп, тоді навіть дияволу треба пастор
Губаста шлюха Смерть хоче мене з лютого двадцять другого
Я сказав: «Вибач, я вже у відносинах, можу буть лише другом»
Тому вона замість мене забрала Олега Вінника
Продюсери спалили все та замінили його на двійника
Твій пікап — це в барі на останнє бабло пригостить шмару
Мій пікап — це авто, де я її трахну, коли вона вийде з бару
Потім куплю повію, вона дасть мені без гонорару
Столична зірка згодна на все — безліміт Кієвстару, ага"

To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

[Verse 2]
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is to let love replace all our hate


[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

So let's go there (Let's go there)
Let's go there (Let's go there)
Come on, let's go there (Go, go there)
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

[Bridge]
Up high, I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Sail up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine
Sail up high, I'm strong enough
To take these dreams and make them mine


[Chorus]
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?"

It’s about driving yourself (deeper) into… Read More Repeat to yourself that they're not really gone
Time has proven that fooling yourself into believing a lie is the most effective way to deal with things you have no control over
Keep listening to the mixtapes they made you
Overanalyze every single word you hear

""Was this a sign that things were going wrong?""
No, no, you were the one who cared too hard, not them
Stay up every single night staring at your phone
Either attempting to gather up the courage to turn these demons
These constant reminders of your loneliness into nothing more than a bad dream
Or praying just for one second you could feel the warmth of equally returned love
Go out for coffee four times a week by yourself
Always bring your notebook, never stop writing
Leave little comics and thank you notes with your tip
Watch them smile as you get in your car
Talk down on yourself whenever possible
""My life is shit because I deserve it, right?""
You must have done something really bad;
It's nearly impossible for you to cry now
Avoid your friends for weeks even though they're the only sense of consistency you have left in your life
If they really wanted to see you, they'd come, but they won't
Who cares?


Allow yourself to lose interest in the things you love
Watch as you begin to take a backseat to the world around you, don't fight it
Become a secondary character in your own motion picture
But most importantly drown every single one of your feelings in old stolen rum
Learn to love the taste of it dripping down your throat
Find comfort in the warmth coming from your stomach
You're drinking bottled love now
You don't need other people to drive away your loneliness
You just needed to find a way to talk to it"

Not to panic while I'm lookin' for the back door
I smelled the perfume and it's obvious
I'm gonna stay and put my key in the bag more

You're the reason I punched a hole in the wall back home
And then, and then, and then a couple hours later
We're in room 29 at The Chateau

I've wasted so much time
Waitin' around for your phone calls every night
My bad dreams are silk-screened
'Cause I taste blood when you bleed
It's eating me alive
We'd both be better off alone
Still think I'd get you on the phone
With one last breath in me
I'd die before I let you leave

Eipä tarvitse niitä itse pestä
Ei mikään enää lähtemästä estä

Mut oon kuin betoniin valettu polviin saakka
Seläs näkymätön tuhat kiloinen taakka
Vaik edessä ois enää yksi rasti
En tiedä jaksanko hautaan asti

Olen vankina täällä ikuisesti
Myös hautausmaata kiertävät aidat
Kun päättyisi viimein maallinen pesti
Mut syvempään kuitenkin maahan vain kaivat
Pidän sinusta mutten itseäni siedä
En tarvitse muita, sinusta en tiedä
Myönnän jos mä lähden
Sen teen vain itseni tähden

En kotoa poistu syyttä ainakaan
Unohtakaa minut, tahdon olla yksin

Hey, after all these years
I'm still here, fingers outstretched
With your imprint in my bed
A pit so big I lay on the edge
Will love let me down again?
Oh no, no, it won't get in
I'm left wonderin'
If it's written on my urn
That I'll burn alone
Like a star

[Chorus]
I wonder how I'll sleep at night
With a cavity by my side
And nothing left to hold but pride, will I
Hold out for more time?

[Verse 2]
Hey me in twenty years
Does your milk still turn to rot too soon?
Do you still hoard souvenirs
And make them mirrors
Of sentimental veneer?

[Chorus]
I wonder how I'll sleep at night
With a cavity by my side
And nothing left to hold but pride, will I...


[Bridge]
Hold out a little bit more?
A little bit more, more, just a little bit more
A little bit more, more, just a little bit more
A little bit longer, just a little bit more (Hold out for more time)
A little bit longer, just a little bit more
A little bit longer, just a little bit more
A little bit more, more, just a little bit more
A little bit more, more, just a little bit more

And I wonder how I'll sleep at night
With a cavity right by my side
And nothing left to hold but pride of mine

Is it laced within my DNA
To be braced in endless January?
Have I become the cavity I feared?

And I don't know where I'll go
And I don't know what I'll see
But I'll try not to bring it back home with me

As you watch me wander, curse the powers that be
‘Cause all I want is here and now
But it’s already been and gone
Our intentions always last that bit too long

Far, far away, no voices sounding
No one around me and you're still there
Far, far away, no choices passing
No time confounds me and you're still there

[Verse 4]
In the full moon's light, I listen to the stream
And in between the silence hear you calling me
But I don't know where I am and I don't trust who I've been
And If I come home, how will I ever leave?"

But now I drive all alone

Love's the funeral of hearts
An ode for cruelty
When angels cry blood
On flowers of evil in bloom
The funeral of hearts
And a plea for mercy
When love is a gun
Separating me from you

She was the sun
Shining upon
The tomb of your hopes and dreams so frail
He was the moon
Painting you
With its glow so vulnerable and pale

And an ode for cruelty
When angels cry blood
On flowers of evil in bloom

And a plea for mercy
When love is a gun
Separating me from you

All the troubles and fears
You've, for years, tried to forget
He was the fire
Restless and wild
And you were like a moth to that flame

Thinking, ""One day, I'ma wife you""
Joking 'round 'cause I'm scared it'll scare you
Look at everything we've been through, oh-oh

Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Verse 1]
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Verse 2]
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain


[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Outro]
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except for when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
(Midnights like this, midnights like this)"

Hello, are you there?
'Cause I missed you at the show tonight (Mmhm)
Anytime, anywhere
I just want to make sure you're alright
If you're off with someone better
Then I won't fault you
What can I do but complain about us?
Times were better, but it seems minute
The grand scheme of things never seemed to like us
We never fit in the same frame
The pictures always cut me out
The right love but in the wrong time frame
Heart too small, you had to push me out (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
(Mmmm, mmmm, mmm)

[Verse 2]
Hello, I'm still here, and I'm holding my tears in my hands (Mmm)
And if you were gonna walk away
The least you could have done was say in advance
""I'm leaving you""
Heartless woman, time-consuming, headache-inducing whore
That's all that you are, that's all you ever were
I'm sorry for bruising you up with my words
But you did the same not too long ago
How does it feel to have your heart in your throat?
And biting the flesh
How does it taste?
I still remember the kisses you gave
To a broken boy
Drown out the noise
Everything that you once had in your voice
Is no longer there, trapped in the void
Of everything that we once tried to destroy
(Hoooo, hoooo, hooooo)"

She, she, she's leaning in

[Intro: Drake]
Yo no sé, yo no sé qué les pasa a estas chicas
Siento que ellas no necesitan amor
Necesitan a alguien que pueda controlarlas
¿Sabes lo que ando diciendo? Te lo diré de bien a mal
Del quien es el inteligente y quien es el tonto
De qué utensilio usar para qué comida, como
Tengo un horario que cumplir aún
No podré realmente
6ix

[Verso 1: Drake]
Estas perras realmente se dejan llevar
Comеten errores y luеgo me ruegan que me quede
Me tienen molestando como si fuera el Arrogante Tae
Tienen mi mente en un lugar terrible
Azotada y encadenada como esclavos Americanos
Actuan como si no estuvieran acostumbrados a las estancias de Sheraton
Conocí al negro que pensaste que podría reemplazarme
¿Cómo se hicieron siquiera comparaciones?
Perra, la próxima vez, lo juro por la tumba de mi abuela
Te estaré adelgazando por las decisiones de niño que tomaste
Cruzándote, cruzándote, cruzándote
Ayy, esto no es lo más pequeño, podría seguir adelante en estas perras
Envié cables en cables sobre cables, como Idris
Tienes suerte de que no retiré lo que me dieron
Podría tenerte en un plan de pago hasta que tengas 150
Y mi slime está aquí, ella tiene algunas barras para todos estos negros
Así que retrocederé y dejaré que SZA hable sus mierdas por un minuto


[Refrán: Drake]
Cruzándote, cruzándote, cruzando

[Verse 2: SZA]
Demonios, estos negros me tienen muy retorcida
¿Cómo carajo eres tan real, pero te haces la perra en mi línea?
Puedo sentir lo que estás gastando
Tengo mucho orgullo para dejar que ningún negro quemado me ensucie
Levántate, ve a montarte, en mi noche, tengo tiempo
Discutamos todas esas mentiras sobre
Manejar esto, como si me estuvieras jodiendo
Y ni siquiera voy a superarlo ahora
Y tú no te refieres a la mierda sobre la que rapeas
Y puedo girar a la puta, lo estoy aireando
Voy a seguir como si estuviera cortada
Tú le dices a estas putas que no estás abrazando
Pero conmigo ya sabes, haciendo toda esa mierda
Les estás diciendo a estas putas que no estás engañando
Pero conmigo ya sabes, lo sabré todo
¿Cómo se dejan llevar tanto los negros?
Equivocándose cuando ese pene apenas consigue el tercer lugar
Follado por lástima; es lindo que seas imbécil
Demonios, porque hay hombres que pueden fingir que les gusta el sexo

[Refrán: SZA]
Cruzándote, estoy cruzándote, estoy cruzando
Oh-woah, woah


[Verso 3: Drake]
Sí, Enero: finges ver la vida con claridad, cada año
Febrero es el momento en que dejas de lado el ojo malo y el orgullo
Por la fantasía de estar casandote; muy aterrador
Marzo ya te hizo dudar en segundos de los títulos
Abril: la Primavera está aquí y al igual que un resorte comienzas a girar en espiral
Mayo trae algunos días más cálidos
Junto a la piscina se pone muy bronceado
Junio te hace moverte helado, yendo y viniendo con un hombre casado
Julio fue cuando descubrí que tú mentiste
Agosto, era ""Bebé esto"", ""Bebé aquello"", como si tuvieras las trompas atadas
Septiembre: estamos cayendo, pero sigo siendo el hombre al que intentas conquistar
Octubre se trata de mí, porque tu turno debería haber acabado
Noviembre: tienes tu panel de humor para el próximo año y estás soltera
Diciembre es el regalo dando un mes y ahora quieres reavivarlo; yo
Intentas generar confianza, mostrándome tus MDs, de como intentan conquistarte
Es irónico cómo las noticias que recibí sobre ti terminaron siendo malas noticias
Ten a un negro disparado por cincuenta parrilladas, niña, la carne cuesta como si fuera Wagyu
Ten a un negro disparado, haré que su culo vea la luz, como una media luna
Saludo a QC, estoy bastante seguro de que hice P Ms como si fuera pasado el mediodía
Todo lo que realmente sé son Ws y Ms, la vida parece un baño
Todo lo que realmente sé son bolsas M, como si hubiera conducido y pedido comida rápida
Diciendo que soy demasiado cauteloso con mis sentimientos, ¿Quién carajo te preguntó?
Siete guardaespaldas, en caso de que alguien realmente quiera intentar colarse
No sé por qué te escucho cuando te oigo hablar conmigo, es una verdad a medias
Si no pago el alquiler, terminará como un viejo peinado, chica, eso es vencido
Si yo no—

Stop right now and listen to
What I have always wanted to
Say to you
I remember long ago
When I was young and you were not as old
As now

Life was easy to believe in
And that is why I've swallowed every single word
You've pushed into my mouth
And made me spit them out
As if they were mine

If you're the one who knows it all
Why have you never bothered to know
How I feel
Why don't you ever call me
Why don't you ever ask me
How arе you today

When, when other pеople ask me
I say, I'm fine, thank you
But I can't talk right now
I'm waiting for another call
To hear no matter what

Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

Goes away in the end
And you could have it all

I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else

Tell me why you're out so late alone
The diamonds sparkle in your face, I hold you
The gravel glistens black and red below

When I close my eyes
You're here
In the dead of the night

When I open my eyes
You disappear

And when it penetrates you, it feels cold
As you were born, you'll leave this world alone
A stranger on an unfamiliar road
The droning engine sings your Hallelujah
The broken headlamp lights your path to God

Want it, so I got it, did it, so it's done

Another day pretendin' I'm older than I am
Another perfect moment that doesn't feel like mine
Another thing I forced to be a sign

Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best

I read somewhere it's 'cause my life feels so out of control
And I tell someone I love them just as a distraction
They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction
They're changin' my machinery, and I just let it happen
I got the things I wanted, it's just not what I imagined

Whatever your shit is, man, do it
Whatever bring you that immense joy, do that, that's your luxury
The greatest thing that ever happened to me was
Bein' damn near twenty and leavin' Los Angeles for the first time
I got out my bubble, my eyes just wide
My passport is the most valuable—

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Massa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me—, ehm, I'ma just go

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, when I turned twenty-three, that's when pubеrty finally hit me
My facial hair started growin', my clothing ain't really fit mе
That caterpillar went to cocoon, do you get me?
See, I was shiftin', that's really why Cherry Bomb sounded so shifty
My taste started changin' from what it was when they met me
But first impression is everything, ain't wanna let me go
Always curious as a child and askin' questions, so
I ain't give no fucks, if, and, buts if they accept me
Yo, my boy Skateboard P gave me that speech in Italy session, um
Thankfully, by hour three it detoured perspective, um
Thoughts changed so rapid, turned to butterfly, Flower Boy happened
All the bees buzzed me, the bugs screamed they loved me
First time I private airlined, accolades, song got airtime
Grew into my style, body, and feelings, and fixed my hairline
Calmed down in front of cameras, business hit tens of millions
I'm not that little boy y'all was introduced to at one-nine
Mom was in the shelter when ""Yonkers"" dropped, I don't say it (I don't say it)
When I got her out, that's the moment I knew I made it (Yeah, yeah)
I don't come from money, they deny it
Since I don't mirror the stereotypical products of my environment
Eight figures in taxes taken, that shit is stupid
A flower gets its petal, they pluck it, but never use it
It's still potholes in the schools, where does it go?
It's still loopholes that I use, nobody knows


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]

I'm on the hunt for perfect but decent is what I been on
I know she fell in love, but commitment is not my end goal
And all my friends that did got too comfy, a little chubby
And that drive to make that money dried up when that nose was runny
We ain't gotta pay attention to the stuff that he battles
Everyone I ever loved had to be loved in the shadows
Tug-of-war with X and Y felt like a custody battle
Felt like the boat goin' down, it felt like I'm missin' a paddle
Might buy that crib in Seattle covered in grass, lackin' gravel (Yeah)
It come with two boats and cattle, I'm livin' sweet, ain't you heard? (Ain't you heard, nigga?)
This perspective from the beak of a bird
You hope I peak, you take my peace
You gon' see me and run like thieves in the night
I'm paranoid, I sleep with a gun
The heat on my dungaroos because they beefin' for fun
I'm vegan for now, I'm conscious, know my hands meet when I bow
I'm grateful, you niggas hateful, you eat at me, you got a plate full
You can't relate to these things I say to these instrumentals
Whether it's wealth talk or shit that's painful
I paint full pictures of my perspective on these drum breaks
Just for you to tell me it's not good from your lunch break

Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men

[Verse 3]
Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad man

[Chorus]
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever young


[Verse 4]
Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later, they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?

[Verse 5]
It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

[Verse 6]
So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
We let them come true

Can't understand, I wonder how
You plan to land back on the ground
You're flying high, head in the clouds
No SOS, you're going down
The world's weighing on your shoulders
Rigged to blow, and ticking closer
Losing hope, not finding closure
Every day, just growing older

[Chorus]
Waiting for Superman to fly from the stars
Praying for a miracle to mend your broken heart
But no one will save you
Your whole world's ending
While you wait, your Superman's too late

[Verse 2]
You hold the line, wait on a sign
Pray all the stars, above align
Salvation in the nick of time
Like heroes fall, right from the sky
With seconds to impact
Still tied to the train tracks
And space-time won't turn back
How can you face that?


[Chorus]
Waiting for Superman to fly from the stars
Praying for a miracle to mend your broken heart
But no one will save you
Your whole world's ending
While you wait, your Superman's too late
Your Superman's too late

[Bridge]
And the whole world is ending while you wait
So what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus]
When no one will save you
Your whole world's ending, but you're
Waiting for Superman to fly from the stars
Praying for a miracle to mend your broken heart
But no one will save you
And you still just won't face your fate
Your Superman's too late

[Outro]
So what are you waiting for? (Superman's too late)
What are you waiting for? (Superman's too late)

[Verso 1: Justin Vernon]
Puedo verte de pie, cariño
Con sus brazos alrededor de tu cuerpo
Riéndote, pero la broma no es nada graciosa
Y te tomó sólo cinco minutos
Para olvidarte de nosotros y dejarme con todo eso
Manteniendo todo este amor aquí en el pasillo

[Coro: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
Creo que he visto esta película antes
Y no me gustó el final
Y ya no eres mi problema
Entonces, ¿a quién estoy defendiendo ahora?
Eras mi ciudad, ahora estoy en el exilio, mirándote de lejos
Creo que he visto esta película antes

[Post-Coro: Justin Vernon]
Uhh, uhh, uhh

[Verso 2: Taylor Swift]
Puedo verte mirándome, cariño
Como si él fuera sólo tú remplazo
Como si tus nudillos sangraran por mí
La segunda, la tercera y la centésima oportunidad
Nos balanceamos sobre ramas frágiles
Esa mirada son un insulto para las heridas


[Coro: Taylor Swift]
Creo que he visto esta película antes
Y no me gustó el final
Ya no soy tu problema
Entonces, ¿a quién estoy ofendiendo ahora?
Eras mi corona, ahora estoy en el exilio, mirándote de lejos
Creo que he visto esta película antes
Así que, me iré por la puerta lateral

Así que vete ya, no existe la cantidad
De lágrimas que pueda llorar por ti

Siempre caminamos sobre una línea muy delgada

Nunca diste una señal de advertencia (Yo di tantas señales)

Nunca aprendí a entender tu mentalidad (Nunca aprendiste a entender mi mentalidad)
No podía cambiar las cosas (Nunca cambiaste las cosas)
Porque nunca diste una señal de advertencia (Di tantas señales)
Tantas señales, tantas señales

Floorboards creaking in my home
Deathly silence when alone
Oh, I wish that you were here right now
So, unlike me, somehow I
Fell in love in just three nights
Those November days still haunting me

[Chorus]
When the gold rays fell on your skin
And my hair got caught in the wind
The choir sang a melancholic hymn
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
In the morning, you would be gone
I'd be mourning, tryin' to hold on to
The memory of your lips
God, I'm so lovesick
What have you done to me?

[Verse 2]
Let me in your atmosphere
Inching closer, but I fear
That I'll love so much, you'll slip away (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Getting twisted in my head
Dreams are nightmares in my bed
Since the last night that I spent with you


[Chorus]
When the gold rays fell on your skin
And my hair got caught in the wind
The choir sang a melancholic hymn (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
In the morning, you're not in my bed
I'll just sleep until I fall dead
To the memory of your lips

[Куплет 1]
Любов і свобода будуть нашими новими законами
Сьогодні посіяна правда завтра зійде волошками
Війною розлучені пари рішуче зламають кордони
Диктатори стануть комашками, їх з'їсть велика ворона
І праві, і ліві обіймуться — єдиний великий народ
Поліцейський і хіпстер з Подолу разом поведуть хоровод
Співати на вулиці, рвати горло — не буде для нас моветоном
Бо мінор і мажор, як відомо, розділені одним напівтоном
А поки:

[Куплет 2]
А згодом вся земля в один момент
Забуде всі лихі слова, які приносять смерть
Вогнепальна, холодна, пневматична
Торпедна, ракетна, метальна, міни
Це ми ще не згадали про біологічну, ядерну та хімічну
Скільки ще треба вигадати прикметників до слова ""зброя""
Щоб нарешті зрозуміти, що абсолютно всі побажання здоров'я
Анулюються лиш одним нерозумним наказом?
Проста людська злоба
Як можна чекати миру, поки цей мир гарантує ядерна бомба?
А поки:

[Приспів]
Хвилями, хвилями, хвилями несе
Милями, милями, милями нас розлучать

Там, де є касарік, точно буде ще касарік
То шо, коли є касарік, можна дути з носу шарік
Пятьорік. Шо надо на пятьорік?
Надо думать, як не проїбати той пятьорік
На пятьорік можна розробить [?]

В чому нахуй сенс, взагалі, понти гонять

Ще і щось за це платить, хм, якесь, блять, божевілля
Поїду краще з батьком куплю на зиму вугілля (На всякій случай)
Спрячь свій Stone'ік, свою беху, підріла
Я інвестую тіки в незалежність України
Остав своїй шаболді ці колхозні виєбони
Я витрачаю cash на недоторканність кордонів
Засунь собі в очко оті три камери iPhone'а

I guess I should stop looking out for you like I always do
When will you start looking out for me too
Instead of leaving me staring at my shoes?
It's just the way you're glancing at me
Something about you just makes me feel guilty for liking you
When you're with him, when you're with him

[Chorus]
This is a love song for a girl who will never know it's about her
I know it's pretty stupid, but I'm much too shy to tell her
She's beaming that smile, all the while
I'm all choked up on my own throat, I guess there is no hope

[Verse 2]
And we're walking out in the snow, I say, ""I guess I should go""
And we're talking 'bout someone else
When we should be talking about ourselves
It's the same old situation, you've always got me waiting
Come on, dear, I think time's a-wastin'
Before we have to go back inside and return to our normal lives

[Chorus]
This is a love song for a girl who will never know it's about her
I know it's pretty stupid, but I'm much too shy to tell her
She's beaming that smile, all the while
I'm all choked up on my own throat, I guess there is no hope"

No care, no care in the world
I don't care, I don't care anymore

Love you in a panic because I prefer to sit on fences
Spit-kissing on my sickbed

But we are like broken instruments
Twisted up and wheezing out the wrong notes
Sleepless folks watching light grow
Through their early morning windows

Oh, I'm too drunk to fight, hurling curses at your surface
Because I'm aware, because it hurts that I'm in love again
And you laugh, kiss my neck, say our arguments are insane
Fighting over the way something was said
While I'm still here like a cheap threat

How I wanted you to promise we would only make

So I just slept it off
You see, my mouth felt like it could talk the end of us
So I just slept it off, slept it off

I can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer)
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real (Nice), I polish up real nice

[Outro]
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer"

[Giriş: RAYE]
Edepsizlik yapıyorum ve sataşıyorum, onun üstünde oturuyorum
Tüm elmaslarım onun üstüne ışıldıyor
Onunla barda buluştum, saat on iki veya öyle bir şeydi
İki şarap daha istedim çünkü bu gece onu istiyorum

[Bölüm 1: RAYE]
Eğer umurunda olacaksa sana olaydan biraz bahsedeyim
Kendimi berbat bir durumun içinde buluyorum
Sevdiğim adam geçen gece beni karşısına oturttu
Ve bana her şeyin bittiğini söyledi, aptalca bir karar
Ve ben kalbimin nasıl parçalandığını hissetmek istemiyorum
Aslında, hissetmek istemiyorum, bu yüzden içmeye devam ediyorum
Ve ben bugün basit bir görevle şehirdeyim
Küçük siyah elbisemin içinde, üstüme de baya bir oturuyor

[Ön-Nakarat: RAYE]
Sadece kalbi kırık bir kaltak, topuklu ayakkabı 15 santimetre
Gece kulübünün arkasında, şampanya yudumluyorum
Takıldığım bu kaltaklara güvenmiyorum
Taksinin arkasında kokain çekiyorum
Sarhoş aramalar, sarhoş mesajlar, sarhoş yaşlar, sarhoş seks
Benimle aynı kafada bir adam arıyordum
Şimdi başa dönüş, bara dönüş
Bentley'e, otele, eski alışkanlıklarıma


[Nakarat: RAYE]
Çünkü geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Doktor, doktor, herhangi bir şey, lütfen
Doktor, doktor, bana acı
Bu acıyı al
Belirtilerimi soruyorsun, doktor, hissetmek istemiyorum

[Bölüm 2: RAYE]
Bu esrarı içiyorum, stresimi böyle atıyorum
2019 gibi eski alışkanlıklarıma döndüm
Eski sevgilimin bitirmesinin üstünden 24 saat bile geçmedi
Üstümde yeni bir adam, biraz terlemek üzereyiz
Geçen gece çok mükâfatlıydı
Kötü günler geçirdim ve bu baya bir canımı yakıyor
Beni mazur gör, benim yatağıma girme umutların
Ne kadar yüksekse benim de kafam o kadar iyi
Bardağı yarı dolu görmek için geri adım atarsam
En azından bu iki parça Prada içinde dolaşıyorum
Ve ben çoktan pislik gibi davranıyorum, ne dediğimi anlıyor musun?
Boş boş duracağına içime sok

Ayrılırken çıplak olacağım ve geldiğimde de çıplaktım, evet

Yani, koşacaksın, evet
Ama asla kaçamayacaksın

Mm, rujum modern sanat gibi dağıldı
Nerede olduğumu ya da lanet olası arabayı kimin kullandığını bilmiyorum
Otoyolda hızlanıyor, yudumluyorum
Hapları likörle karıştırıyorum, bu duyguları sikeyim
Sevdiğim herkesi görüldüde bıraktım (Uh-huh)
Yatağımdaki yabancıya sırlarımı döküyorum (Uh-huh)
Hiçbir şey hatırlamıyorum bu yüzden pişman olacak bir şey yok (Uh-uh)

Red eyes and a cold smile
Dim lights at the shoreline
You say that I am a runaway
I just can't find the words to say
A soft breeze in the palm trees
On an island, but I don't give a—
Don't let me be misunderstood
If I could change, you know I would

Got tired of it all somehow
I won't make it, can't fake it
Oh, I gotta get away

I'm goin' down in my bedroom exile

Yesterday is a lost friend
On my island at the world's end

Tryna hold on to somethin' real
Tryna live up to great ideals

Yeah, well

I got a bone to pick like roses (Roses)
I ain't feelin' broken no more
Balled a fist, they gossipin', I notice
Talkin' shit, I wander through the motives
Wonder who the fuck we're supposed to be
I ain't worried now 'til I leave
I'm just tryna ride and feel the breeze
With somethin' bad beside n' next to me
Wind in my face, don't stop now when it feels so great
You can run 'til you slip on the sidewalk
And the same bone that you picked gon' break, that's a motif
(That's a motif) Yeah
When it's comin' right back, so familiar, never been realer
Never felt so damn good where I'm at
I don't know what it's all about
Runnin' through too many thoughts to count (That's way better)
Still ain't addin' up, I'll let you know when I've had enough, yeah
Yeah, well

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd put some money on forever, but I (Hey)
Don't like to gamble on the weather, so I
Just watch while
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, I know
Hey, well

These are my wings, yeah
These are my wings

Movin' so fast, the clock look slow (Slow)
Water my seeds 'til the flower just grow, yeah
Love so much that my heart get broke
I don't really know how the normal shit go, so
I guess I just play it by ear, silence is all that I hear
Listenin' close as I can
Growin' up (One, two, three), jump
Nobody holdin' my hand, no
Trust is a problem, never knew how, yeah
That's why I just keep to myself
Get what I need, then I'll be out (Please tell me)
Who can surf the universe with me?
Lucifer is human, so are we
All I ever want is what I need
And that don't include your time and company
Follow me, we on the up and up
Remember when I owed a hundred bucks?
Now, I look around like, ""What the fuck?""
If you don't fuck with me, you fuckin' up


[Pre-Chorus]
I know I need to watch my temper, so I
Don't ever gamble on the weather, but I

I readed all the comments sayin', ""D, I'm really shooketh""

You're lucky 'cause I just paid your bill with a reply
I just made your money pile knee-high
I just made your stats peak, now you got a blue check

Now you can afford to not be lousy, go and do shit
Talk your shit about me, I can easily disprove it, it's stupid
You follow me, but you don't really care about the music

Look at me, look at me, I'm naked
Vulnerability earned me a lot of bacon
I put a thong all in my ass and taught you how to shake it
I paid all my respect to those who taught me how to make it
And now I reap the benefits with no confrontation
Y'all fall into beef, but that's another conversation
I'm sorry, but we all find it really entertainin'
'Cause we all wanna see them slip and fall right on their faces
And we all wanna be the one to see the devastation
Not be in it, but ain't the bad press good?
The disrespect's real, how this Patek look?
Pull out the checkbook, now why yo' neck crook?
I never learn to ""superstar"" from a textbook
Talkin' 'bout, ""She fallin' off, why she get booked?""
Man, I been humble, I'm tired of all the deprecation
Just let me flex, bruh, just let me pop shit

Коли я одна, почуваюсь дивно

One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowin' when to stop
Sunglasses indoors
Par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles

[Verse 2]
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sippin' her drink and laughin' at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem


[Verse 3]
She's a certified mind blower
Knowing full well that I know
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want you
To do me no good
And you look like you could

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
The look of love, the rush of blood
The ""She's with me""s, the Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs, the Camera Plus
The black & white and the colour dodge
The good time girls, the cubicles
The house of fun, the number one
Party anthem, oh


[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem

Trying to clear my head by balancing on ballerina bars
And that's a ballerina bar
I'll pack it up then ferment it in a mason jar

Carry it around in my brand new fancy car
Buy one of those plane tickets to Mars
I'm at the bar and it's a bargain
Fought myself in circles bout the flip from public to private

I'm a freak, I know every answer


Rum pum pum pum I'mma set the pace
I'mma dunk bread on Italian lace
'Cause I do what I want, I do what I like
And you can't call my bluff when I roll the dice

And I apologize if I take it too far
But I get bored wearing all of these scars
I'm not alone but I'm a loner

Then we went out to the other place in town
Then I fell down and I-

But then she took me back to the store and I found my mom
But everyone was really mad at me
But I-I didn't do anything wrong"

Зникнути з тобою
Куди кине око враз
Залишилась молодою
Найкоштовніша з прикрас
Вона квітне із весною
Я відчув це рік назад

[Куплет]
Я завжди відрізняв діаманти посеред стразів
Хто шукає, той завжди знайде заплутане щастя
Мої тисячі крапель терпіння стримують від швидких вражень
Ти неодмінно засвоєш урок, якщо він був важким
Хвилювання, холодний піт, і все це без жаху
Вплив уваги, чотирьох стін — сам себе у це втягнув
Я оглянув усіх до деталей — досі не жахнуло
Серце не хоче побічних завдань — залиши його гнати кров
Викладаю все на стіл
Тимчасово окрім тебе
Ти пітнієш, і стікає стиль
Шкіра розтягнулась, як тіні на стелі
Наші тіла — павутина, ми в змозі плести
Вкрив її ключиці простинею
Ніби хижий, не схожий, принаймні на вид
Але чую своє за кілометри
Я не змішую правду з брехнею
Але нині її ніхто не скаже
Хто створив у тобі королеву?
Хто помічав у тобі лише справжнє?
Мої руки ще досі на пульсі
Я втратив любов, хоч плекав свою карму
Стимул тягне до важкого люксу
Чутливий на слух — я роблю це не дарма

[Intro: Doja Cat]
Sí, te quiero

[Verso 1: Doja Cat]
Estoy en un bajón, así que te compré un ramo de rosas
Y las corté de tu puerta, tu nuevo barrio es hermoso
Pagué mucho dinero por los perfumes que usabas cuando salíamos
Y vendí limonada solo para poder pagarlos
Sé que no es una buena ocasión para irrumpir
No pude evitar verte besándola junto al fregadero
Abrí la puerta, entré de puntillas
No estaba llorando, estaba mirando fijamente y olvidé parpadear
Ella me vio parada junto al televisor y no dejaba de gritar
Así que traté de ser discreta y le dije: ""Cálmate""
Agarró un cuchillo de cocina, así que saqué la pistola
No siempre la tengo, gracias a Dios que la tenía en ese momento
Porque ella estaba furiosa, y todo lo que yo veía eras tú
Sucedió en un instante cuando me atacó
Se cruzaron, la vi caer al suelo
Luego te detuviste allí horrorizado, pero ese disparo no era para ella

[Coro: SZA, Doja Cat]
Podría (¿No lo era?)
Podría matar a mi ex, no es la mejor idea
Y después a su nueva novia, ¿cómo llegué aquí?
Podría matar a mi ex, aunque todavía lo amo
Prefiero estar en la cárcel que sola


[Verso 2: SZA]
Tengo la sensación de que es una causa perdida
Tengo la sensación de que realmente podrías amarla
El texto será evidencia, este texto es evidencia
Intento ser justa contigo, sin moral ni crímenes pasionales
Pero, joder, estabas fuera de alcance
Estabas en el mercado con tu melocotón perfecto
Ahora estoy sorprendida, jugando con mi paciencia
Ahora inclinas tu rostro, me tienes diciendo esto encima de un ritmo

[Pre-Coro: SZA]
Soy tan madura, soy tan madura
Soy tan madura, tengo un terapeuta que me dice que hay otros hombres
No los quiero, solo te quiero a ti
Si no puedo tenerte, nadie debería, podría

[Coro: SZA]
Podría matar a mi ex, no es la mejor idea
Y después a su nueva novia, ¿cómo llegué aquí?
Podría matar a mi ex, aunque todavía lo amo
Prefiero estar en la cárcel que sola

Lo hice todo por amor (Amor)
Lo hice todo sin drogas (Drogas)
Lo hice todo sobria
Lo hice todo por nosotros, oh

Квіти вдень і вночі, рожеве листя дерев
Палало все без дощів, і міліон кольорів
Ясність знову поверталася, зникали миті радості
Востаннє посміхалися у пошуках буденості
Байдуже на цілий світ, чекаю вічно зустрічі
Ми глянем тихо на зеніт, чекаю спів манголії

[Приспів: SadSvit & Лилу45]
Автомагістралі і ми всю ніч
По ним гуляли, лиш облиш
Остання твоя й моя зустріч
Чом ти в грудях так болиш?
Автомагістралі і ми всю ніч
По ним гуляли, лиш облиш
Остання твоя й моя зустріч
Чом ти в грудях так болиш?

Чом ти в грудях так болиш?
Чом ти в грудях так болиш?
Чом ти в грудях так болиш?
Чом ти в грудях так болиш?"

One, two, one, two

[Verse 1]
Yo, punk-ass bitch, sit down, shut your mouth
I'm the cemetery killer coming right from the south
Bitch, I lay by the crypt, bitch, I'm so underground
I've been searching for the peace, now I know, can't be found
So I pull up with the gun with the ""click-clack-pow"" in your face
And my teeth, they're yellow from the cig smoke days
Bitch, I creep through the town, covered up in haze
And I'm up to my neck with the shit you say

[Chorus]
We are caught up in our lies
You can't escape this time
They eat you from the inside, it's right

[Verse 2]
I be that twisted motherfucker, see me underneath the bed
Bitch, I'm always undercover, I'm the loony, psychopath
Put the dick inside your mother, then I suffocate your dad
'Cause I like the feel of violence, I'm another face of death
I grab your bitch by the throat and I feed her the semen!
Now you know you should not fuck with the demon!
I grab your bitch by the throat and I feed her the semen!
Blade to the neck, bitch, I don't need a reason


[Chorus]
We are caught up in our lies
You can't escape this time
They eat you from the inside, it's right

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
She could ride my face, I don't want nothin' in return
Except for some her time and all her love, that's my concern
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house and turn it to a yard
If you don't know my grandma name, then we ain't really dogs, bitch

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I shook your hand, I don't respect
Don't call me king, I'm not your twin
I'm not your brother, we just met
See, I won't purchase her no Birkin (Uh)
Got hobbies (Uh), got purpose (Woo)
Got thumpers, I'm perfect (Uh)
Yeah, Kelly green wagon look better when the gloom out
Canary shine brighter in the dark, I brought the moon out
The plane fly better when it's just me and the pilot
Tuition for the mileage, it's worth it for the silence
There he go, he cast broads like radios
Shit, your lady knows, it's Young T like baby clothes
And I got that fire, and I got good dick
Guap long, dick long, plus I look good, bitch (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

She could ride my face, I don't want nothin' in return (Woo)
Because if she get off, then I get off, that's my concern (Oh, man)
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house and turn it to a yard (Yeah, yeah, turn up that shit)
If you don't know my grandma name, then we ain't really dogs, bitch

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
That's a lot of motherfuckin' necklace
Five, six, seven is the figure for a setlist (Yeah)
Ring, ring, ring, bitch, pick up the phone
I don't care if y'all together, I will tear down a home, shit
I shimmy through Paris in back of Phantom of the threads
The driver's seat of the Enzo could barely fit my legs
And Virgil my chaperone, he look out from overhead (Love you, V)
Not sure what you overheard, but it's probably what I said, bitch
I'm out here livin', y'all on the feed (Yuck)
My girl look like Zazie Beetz and Kelis (Yuck)
I pull up in the ""What the fuck is that, dog?"" (I said, ""Yuck"")
It's Mr. Peculiar, that's who I be, who I be
Niggas tellin' women how they bodies supposed to be, but
Never take advice from any nigga with a lean gut (Fuck these niggas)
Keep your chair rockin' and my two cents in your pocket
Your only option, I don't play no motherfuckin' games

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
She could ride my face, I don't want nothin' in return
And will I ever fall in love again? I can't confirm
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house and turn it to a yard
If you don't know my daughter name, then we ain't really—

These niggas be textin' with kids, it doesn't get stranger than this, that's ho shit
Fuck a bar, I don't fuck with you niggas, like I'm Hulk Hogan (Wait)

While you stretchin' the truth in your tweets

Watch your energy, watch what you tweet
You can go from Elon to Ye in a week, buddy (Buddy, buddy, buddy)

Blacked-out, can't think no more
So ain't no way we 'bout to take this slow
In that never seen before
Behind the scenes, on that cuttin' room floor
Smokin' on that, don't need no more
So lemme tell ya where we gon' go
To a place you won't ever wan' leave
Got it locked, hid the set of keys
In your head, girl, I'm rent free
She can't stop thinkin' about me
So drop it low like you pickin' up change
Go'n 'head girl do your thang

Back once again
A-a-and you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
Anything about me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me
Me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me
Me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me

No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
When we were together, I tried to tell you
I used to tap dance and I was in choir
And I broke my arm when my dad crashed the go-kart
He didn't mean to, my mom didn't buy it
I tried on your lipstick, I thought I looked pretty
But you didn't care, no, 'cause you're always busy
And you're always busy, so you never hear me


[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
So you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
Do I sound like a joke when I'm talking to you?
I take it back quick and I nod like ""true""
'Cause you say so many things, and I don't know what I mean
Short messages to you, short messages to me
Now if I think of a joke when I say goodbye
I put my palms on my face and pretend to cry
But I'll laugh too fucking hard, you probably think I'm so mean
But I don't even know you, and now you'll never really know

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
And you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

[Bridge: Laura Les]
I guess it's such an easy game
If it puts you right to sleep
Rationale and cheap cliché
Hollow and callously
Could you explain it all away?
Like it was all so clean?
Somethings sad about the way it's ""okay, bet, I forget""
And I guess I never knew, but I don't think I'll forget
It's cool, I guess I'll never know


[Chorus: Dylan Brady and Laura Les]
(Yeah you'll never really) Know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me

[Outro: Dylan Brady and Laura Les]
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me (Wooooh!)

I smell cowards and sons of a bitch
Everything quick all smells like shit

I roll over but it's empty
You used to lay here beside me
I swallow my pride 'cause it's all on me
Is it too late? Forgive me
Did you mean what you said? Are you angry?
Lost more than a friend, now I'm on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I'm praying tonight
But if you can hear me
Tell me if you hear me

[Chorus]
And I should have called
And I should have tried
And I should have walked you home every night
And I should have kissed you ten thousand times
Just to tell you I love you
I should have done it all
All for you, baby
But now I'm just a little too late
To be what you needed
But I hope that he is

[Verse 2]
You took me around but we got nowhere
'Cause you were naive while I was too scared
So when we lit a fire, you run towards the flames
And I stood around and I watched you burn
Then I rose up to claim you and left you in the dirt
Kept my hands to myself like I kept my word
Fool you once, never twice, I guess you've learned


[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know why I'm praying tonight
But if you can hear me
Tell me if you hear me

[Chorus]
And I should have called
And I should have tried
And I should have walked you home every night
And I should have kissed you ten thousand times
Just to tell you I love you
I should have done it all
All for you, baby
But now I'm just a little too late
To be what you needed
But I hope that he is

[Bridge]
I shouldn't have promised that I'd never fall
But you saw the writing all over the walls
I try not to cry in the places we'd go to
But I still fucking care for you

[Chorus]
I hope that he calls
I hope that he tries
I hope that he walks you home every night
I hope that he kisses you ten thousand times
Just to tell you he loves you"

There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever (Forever)
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

[Chorus]
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

[Verse 2]
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby, baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

[Verse 3]
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse, and so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever (Forever)
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then


[Chorus]
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

[Verse 4]
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now


[Chorus]
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see

Hey guy - you're the one for me
Your face - the sweetest thing I've ever seen
Stop by - dedicate to me
Your time - your time
At night - it really gets to me
I find nobody is here with me
Stop by - say you'll stay with me
You're the one I really miss

[Chorus]
Every single day - single hour
I can see your face - single day
Every single day - single hour
I can see your face - single day

Every single day - single hour
I can see your face - single day
Every single day - single hour
I can see your face - single day

[Verse 2]
Hey guy - you're the one for me
Those eyes - the loveliest I've ever seen
Stop by - Just to say to me
You're mine - you're mine
This time lay some love on me
I'm blind - to anything surrounding me
So fine when you're next to me
You're the one I can't resist"

[Verso: Logic]
Tú no puedes tener suficiente, no, yo no puedo tener suficiente
Tomé otra ruta, no, nunca terminé en esposas
Tenía una pistola en mi mano, pero no quería ser tal hombre
Miro en el espejo, no podía ver a ese hombre
Tomé la pluma, nunca me enfrento a los hombres
Solo tomo el arma si necesito defenderme
Si lo hice en ese entonces, podría haber caído muerto
Conozco a un negro que hace mucho porque es un exaltado
Di un paseo por mi ciudad el otro día
Me pregunto qué hubiera pasado si todo hubiera sido al revés
Salté en el carro, ahora lo recuerdo
En los días en que estaba corriendo por el Ave
Nunca podría haber imaginado la forma en que mi vida lo tendría
Resultó y todas las cosas esas las tengo
No estoy hablando del material, hablando de mi material
Esta mierda que estoy escribiendo, la mierda por la que he pasado
Pasé por lo peor, pero logré salir
Como el Alpha Omega, para mostrarme de qué manera podría ir
Sí, él lo expusimo
En lugar de simplemente sentarme en la playa
Me estoy reconectando con las calles
Ellos no andaban prestando atención, estaba orando por la ascensión
No es necesario mencionar mi atención al detalle
Hermano, nos prevaleceremos
Muchos hijos de puta quieren despertarse todos los días
Luego asesinan a los suyos, pero saben que es de otra manera
Al carajo toda la violencia y las drogas en las comunidades
Esta canción de aquí es inmunidad
Ellos le llaman la trampa, porque ellos lo atraparon
Y solo toman nuestro dinero, luego no nos lo devuelven
El hombre negro ni siquiera puede conseguir una licenciatura
Abandonó la escuela, luego él tomó una espátula
Porque él nunca tuvo un buen modelo a seguir, solo un modelo a seguir del barrio
Ahora sé que ese es el modelo antiguo
Rompemos ese ciclo
Creo que veo la línea de meta
Tengo una visión ahora, no disminuyas la mía
Muchos hermanos en el barrio están bien
Y sé que lo veo todo el tiempo
Pero solo quieren hacer
Toda la droga y todo el crimen en Canal 9
Al carajo toda esa falacia, esta mierda de aquí es para mi gente
Gente que lucha, gente que trabaja duro como puede
Pero todavía no se sienten iguales
Confía en mí, lo sé, he estado allí antes
Confía en mí, lo sé, ese sentimiento nunca se va


[Estribillo]
Cada día me despierto, cada día me despierto
Cada día me despierto, cada día me despierto
Cada día me despierto, cada día me despierto
Cada día me despierto, cada día me despierto

Cada día me despierto, cada día me despierto
Cada día me despierto, cada día me despierto
Cada día me despierto, cada día me despierto

[Outro: Lucy Rose]
Y en un hermoso día de Otoño en 2011
Logic y sus mejores amigos recorren los barrios marginales de College Park en un Chevy Impala
Por las calles del condado de Prince George
Navegando por un universo desconocido
Comenzando un viaje que inevitablemente alteraría el rumbo
No solo de los suyos
Pero la vida de millones de personas en todo el mundo"

[Куплет 1: DIME]
В моїх снах все було так, ніби вибрали вірний шлях
Вже забув, які емоції мають солодкий смак
Скільки пройшло — перестав боятись панічних атак
Голос всередині каже, що треба йти, або я щось роблю не так
Прощання та й годі, бачу тебе знову
Якщо не терпіти, хто нам допоможе?
Не залишай тут самого: я з розуму схожу
Навіщо чекати? Я більше не можу

[Куплет 2: Райчу]
У-у, я у твоїх снах
І зникнути у них — це і є мій найбільший страх
Нічого не знаю про жаль
Але мені так сумно, коли вбачаю в тобі печаль
Головний біль у себе просто закутав
Я хочу з тобою бути кожну мить, як це забути?
Тебе вдихнути, як повітря, набрати повні груди
Та я боюсь перенасититись: усі ми тут люди
І я у твоїх снах — це здавалось дивним
Я не стану вітром, щоб не відлетіти
Без тебе все, як у пітьмі
Стань моїм ліхтарем — вкажи мені
Дорогу: я не знаю, куди йти
Підкажи: куди йти? Куди йти?

Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood

Hope you can handle this curve
Uh, foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge, I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97, I bite

I can try very easily, I'm a guy and a giant

Bird bitch, take flight, no pilot
Serve dick, curve bitch, no bias
Back up, back up, chick, bad timing
I got to get on stage, you better get on page
I have you looking out the windowpane
Or in the rain or anything but in a way
And if I say that's what it is, forget the lip
Now, what's my point, now I forget—damn, this bitch
Got me fuckin' up my script, fuck this shit, I got this shit
Gettin' to the point where everybody say they from the block and shit
With Glocks and shit and poppin', pimpin', trappin', sippin' lean
Y'all niggas fall for anything, you got the plug in Medellín?

Again, never been shit, never had shit, (Woah) never knew shit (Woah)
Never out, never do shit, damn (Look)

Give me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia
Wheeled yo' bitch out my bed in a gurney
You gotta leave lil' mama, the clock's turning

Get the pack out the package

Con te non c'è niente da fare
Nascosta dai lunghi capelli
Tu balli, ma i gesti son quelli

Ti muovi, mi sfuggi, mi arrendo

Se chiamarmi vagabondo oppure burattino telecomandato
Quante volte mi son chiesto: ""Ma perché lo fai?
Non vedi che di amici veri non ne hai?
E tra mille delusioni ho cercato sempre di sentirmi su""

Ma quando canto io sono sincero più che mai
Sono contento soltanto in mezzo a tutti voi
E poi non vendo fantasia, ma momenti della vita mia

E vorrei sentirmi libero di dare un bacio e regalare un fiore
Mi farei le foto proprio come quando andavo in gita con le suore
Forse troverò una donna che mi amerà
Di un amore che non pensa a tutto ciò che avrà
E un amico che mi ascolta quando sono triste e ho voglia di parlare

Ma quando canto mi scordo di tutti questi guai
E quando canto io vivo in mezzo a tutti voi
Perché di questa vita mia non voglio farne solamente un disco e via
Ma tra mille delusioni ho cercato sempre di sentirmi su

Ma quando canto io sono sincero più che mai
Sono contento soltanto in mezzo a tutti voi
E poi non vendo fantasia pensando solamente a fare un disco e via
E per una volta ancora resterà soltanto questa mia illusione
E non so se ho fatto bene andando a registrare questa mia canzone
E sarà già stato detto tante volte, ma
Per ognuno c'è una propria e sola verità
E tra mille delusioni cercherò di nuovo di sentirmi su"

Ma come è strano il fato

""Non credo a queste cose

E lui, dopo averlo analizzato
Ha rilasciato un certificato

Get on your dancing shoes
There's one thing on your mind
Hopin' they're lookin' for you
Sure you'll be rummagin' through
Oh and the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Yeah, but it's oh so absurd

The lights are flashin'
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretendin' to dance
Don't act like it's not happening
As if it's impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same as they all do and hope for the best

Could you love me when the water's rough

На Подолі біля Гриші буду я чекати
Запроси мене на каву
Знаю, тут на Золотих місцина є цікава
Хочу я у парк Шевченка

Хоч вези у Пуща-Водицю, киця

Le pregunto a dónde va, porque de veras quiero
Me pregunto si sabe que estamos bajo agua
Así son las cosas en esta maravilla de ciudad

[Verso 1: Bootie Brown]
Me fui al lugar, soy uno de los pocos
Mucho de todo, pero nada que hacer
Tumbado en el Tesla, perdona al exluchador
Él sale con Francesca, han tomado Xannies
Liposucción prevista para la abuela
Ella quiere ahorrar un poco, operar su trasero
Viaje de chicas, Miami en fin de año
Cielos llenos de polución, trato de pensar claro
Escuché las malas noticias cuando derramaba una cerveza
Cuidado con los cultos, Paul Revere
Todos desempeñamos nuestro papel en la alegría del diablo
Corre hacia las colinas porque el fin se acerca

I remember everything
So I can't take back anything
Unless that’s how I'm meant to feel
Find myself a better deal

[Pre-Chorus]
So maybe
I better tie this up
I bet it all goes wrong

[Chorus]
Do what they say, say, say
Could do with a drop of rain
I know when it's not ok
Can't keep my head down
Don't like
Whenever I'm not in pain

[Verse 2]
Peeling back not noticing
The blood and bones beneath my skin
Feelings that we can't compare
Taking chances anywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
So maybe
I can't care too much
I can't clean this up


[Chorus]
Do what they say, say, say
Could do with a drop of rain
I know when it's not ok
Can't keep my head down
Don't like
Whenеver I'm not in pain
Whenevеr I try complain
To you we are all the same
Can't keep my mouth shut this time
Is that what they say, say, say

[Bridge]
Love is raised by common thieves
Hiding diamonds up their sleeves
Always I did it for you
Never felt so sure
You're my best machine
You're my midnight sun
Always I did it for you

[Verse 3]
I remembered every line
If we go through it one more time
So show me how to split the real
Get me off this spinning wheel


[Pre-Chorus]
So baby
I better turn this up
I hope it drowns you out

[Chorus]
It that why they say, say, say
Could do with a drop of rain
It's that why it's so mundane?
Can't keep my eyes closed, too long
Whenever I'm not in pain
Whenever I try to explain
To you, we are not the same
Can’t keep my hands up far from
Is that why they say, say, say?

[Bridge]
Love is raised by common thieves
Hiding diamonds up their sleeves
Always I did it for you
Never felt so sure
You're my best machine
You're my midnight sun
Always I did it for you

[Outro]
Love is raised by common thieves
Hiding diamonds up their sleeves
Always I did it for you
Never felt so sure
You're my best machine

Uh-oh, ye-ah, uh-oh, ye-ah-oh
Uh-oh, ye-ah, uh-oh

[Verse 1: Ryan Guldemond]
I wear women's underwear
And then I go to strike a pose in my full-length mirror
I cross my legs just like a queer
But my libido is strong when a lady is near, yeah
What defines a straight man's straight?
Is it the boxer in the brief or a twelve-ounce steak? Nah
I'll tell you what a woman loves most
It's a man you can slap but can also stroke

[Chorus: Molly Guldemond & Debra-Jean Creelman]
Goin' in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's naked
It's verbatim, and it's shakin'
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no more getting elated
No more listless invitations

[Post-Chorus: Ryan Guldemond]
UGH!

[Verse 2: Ryan Guldemond]
I live by a hospital
And every day, I go out walking past its sickly windows
I see people dyin' there
But my tender age makes it hard to care
The incinerator and a big smokestack
It's a phallic symbol and it makes me laugh (Ha)
All I need is a heart attack, c'mon
Humble my bones with a cardiac (Humble my bones with a cardiac)

Goin' in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's naked

Давно хотів тебе, але без знайомства це гидко (фу)

Зустрілись пару годин тому

Ти тулишся до мене якомога ближче
Стоп кадр і ми вже удвох лежим у ліжку

На нас дивиться твоя кішка

Hey, no ins and outs
You come out, your shit is gone, bitch

[Verse 1]
Goin' back to Tangier with some Jordans and a spear
Post-Christian shit, post-chicken-or-the-egg-addiction shit
Pass the sherm stick, Neo-reality
Be the freak you wanna see, just don't follow me
I'm on a journey to the center of three
Grab your fucking chain and drag you through the bike lane
While everybody's like (Nooooo!)
I got this pregnant snake; stay surrounded by long hairs
A plethora of maniacs and spiral stairs
Make your water break in the Apple Store
Sink or swim, who fucking cares, cut the birth cords
Press send, yeah, thick
Gaga can't handle this shit, headed for the Sammy Davis wing
Throw up a black hole at the entrance of Linens-n-Things
On the way, never call it a day
Visit Tesla's grave for the ninth time today
Still on the way, bigger wigs

Out where the lightning splits the sea

Through the wind and the chill and the rain

[Куплет 1]
Я, Херсон, дивлюсь на себе в дзеркало, не впізнаю
Намагаюсь пригадати, як було колись давно
Коли я народився від мільйонів рук
Націй всього світу, московитам ручок не дано
Мені не тре в Європу, я сам Європа
Українське місто, в рускіх — полосата роба
Міста ями, міста для дефекацій
А в мене свіжий бриз, пахне акація
Моє серцебиття чути від електростанцій
До полів з кавунами, поки дуб не спиляли
Я живу і чекаю на свою сім'ю
Зі священною зброєю в руках, не забувай мене
Бо в моїх кафешках грає українська музика
І рускі макарони шось не продаються
На відміну від їхніх солдат, шинель без ґудзика
Хочуть пити? То Дніпра з кров'ю хай нап'ються
Мені складно без людей на вулиці Суворова
Я трохи схожий на місто з роману Орвела
Мої жителі зникають за фарами автівок
Але я повернуся додому, як хотіли

[Приспів]
Мій Херсон, знов і знов сниться твій Таврійський край

Мій Херсон, знов і знов сниться твій Таврійський край

Раніше я носив банер — місто щасливих людей
Але всі ці люди в березні насупили брови
Показали окупанту, шо таке ідея
Лякливого сонця здобули промінь
Хай ненадовго, та я пишаюсь ними як дітьми
Я відхаркую кров кольору пітьми
Я вже пережив давно свої часи дрімучі
Відверніться від екрану, якшо телевізор включений
Я приберіг пляшечку вина, все майже готово
Аби відсвяткувати повернення додому
Я не благатиму — будь ласка, відпустіть
Буду битись до останнього — я вже на мості

And I wondered if he could ever see me that way
He was on my list at the grocery store
When you grabbed my wrist and said you liked my keychain
Read your feature in the weekly paper
And honestly, I found it a little bit bloated
Friday, we fell through the coffee table
And that’s when I discovered that my heart exploded

You're a lollipop
In the form of a lightning bolt
You're a lollipop in my hair
But I'm a gumdrop
Am I ever gonna fit that mould?
'Cause I don't have the patience to wait in line for you

[Verse 2]
When I came back to apologize
You asked me if I was intrigued by LSD
I sat next to you on the picnic bench
And before I knew it, you were flying next to me
I met your baby at the exposition
And frankly, I found it a little unnerving
I let you know when we were driving home
And all I can remember is the fact that we're swerving

You're a lollipop
In the form of a lightning bolt
You're a lollipop in my hair

And I don't have the time to wait in line for you

You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were getting their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was getting mine

Mississippi queen
If you know what I mean
Mississippi queen
She taught me everything

[Verse 2]
This lady, she asked me
If I would be her man
You know that I told her
I'd do what I can


[Pre-Chorus]
To keep her looking pretty
Buy her dresses that shine
While the rest of them dudes were making their bread
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was losing mine

I don't know what you wanna hear
Things changing course, smiles fade to grin
Now the moment's gone, just as I feared
And I was hoping, and I was hoping this time

[Verse 2]
No longer here, we were feeling bliss
Don't hold your tongue, there's no time for tricks
You've been closing up, I expected this
But I was hoping that you'd stay open this time

[Chorus]
I know it won't be long
I know you're almost gone
Hold on, let me in before the day is over
Just let me in before the day is over

[Verse 3]
Say something soon, we might lose it all
Something we can use to break our fall
There's nothing left to do when we start to stall
And I was hoping that we could hold it this time

[Chorus]
I know it won't be long
I know you're almost gone
Hold on, let me in before the day is over
Just let me in before the day is over
Let me in, let me in
Just let me in before the day is over


[Bridge]
I can't take another day
I could go insane
There's only so much I can take
I can't live this way
I can't take another day
I could go insane
There's only so much I can take
I can't live this way

Let me in, let me in (I know it won't be long)
Just let me in before the day is over (I know you're almost gone)

You fucked up your last try, you cannot try (Last try)
We were in the studio, I was just playin'
You were all work and I was all play and
You were talkin' business, aimin' with your weapon
I was on your hit list, I felt the compression

I'll never go, I'll haunt your studio
You won't think of words when you write it up
You'll just hear me singin' this song

Trato o rap como se eu tivesse vendendo pedra
No fogão com o frasco de Pyrex
A porta fica trancada, diz, não bata
Estamos no quarteirão deles, dominamos tudo
São jogos de Monopoly, roubamos as suas propriedades
Falando suavemente e andando na lua
Os mesmos moleques do lago pequeno, mas com um tubarão na piscina

Давай поговорим. Вимкни екран, заховай телефон у кишеню
Годі готувати собі горенько на вечерю, 24 на 7 з четверга по середу
Ти там як взагалі? Що по бессонні? Що по ПТСРу?
Ця ніч — забуття, чи нові страхи принесе тобі?
Хто надішле ППО проти панічних, а не ракетних атак?
Твій західний партнер спить, обіймаючи справа, чи ти одинак?
Чи ти мігруючий птах?
Від війни всередині не віднесуть ані крила, ані найшвидший літак
Так, така собі доля, згоден, але вона твоя
З лютого тобі стало не соромно вже, тобі стало так просто боятись
І я такий самий, роблю вигляд, нібито знаю хоч шось
Та вчора шукав у пабліках пісню «Все буде добре» — жодної не знайшлось
Хоча ні, одна є. Про те, що небо дає тіки те, що можем подужать
Вона про те, що навіть під бомбами люди люблять та дружать
Вона про спокій, той, де хрущі та вишні
Вона про те, що все закінчиться за два-три тижні
Так, знаю оптимізм на війні — то є хижак, а не здобич
Та, коли навколо суцільний жах, кожен сам собі Арестович
Ми влаштовані так, що віримо в краще, і саме тому Земля крутиться досі
Голі, поранені, босі, та це не кінець, це досвід
Так, ми Homo sapiens, але не всі sapiens та не всі homo
Homo не позбавляють один одного дому
Боляче, сумно, минуле назавжди полишено
Та я бачу, як посміхається небо, — всередині тиша


[Приспів: ValeryBlahBlah]
What a big deal? Полюбити тишу, щоб почати свій спів
Сльози — то сіль. Ти лише людина, тож не стримуй свій біль
Скіки не вий, там, де вже руїни, не збудуєш новий
Той самий дім. Та життя іде і небо посміхається всім
What a big deal? Полюбити тишу, щоб почати свій спів
Сльози — то сіль. Ти лише людина, тож не стримуй свій біль
Скільки не вий, там, де вже руїни, не збудуєш новий

Мені подарували війну
Вона була загорнута в Гради, танки, снаряди, кулі, тіла та вибухи

Відкривати не дуже хотілось, але то все ж таки подарунок
Тож треба видихнути і розгорнути — так і роблю
Під обгорткою щось, чого я раніше не бачив
Знав про це, чув, але раніше ніколи не бачив
П'ятий день розгортаю і видно, що Всесвіт його взяв не на здачу
А обирав, хотів догодити або віддячити
За що саме віддячити, я так і не взнаю, до свого жалю
Тому що під обгорткою ті, кого дійсно любиш
Може, раніше не знав, але зараз це точно
Під обгорткою ті, чий ти сон зберігаєш
І дивишся у заплакані від паніки очі, але радієш, бо вони тут
Сльози закінчаться, очі залишаться
І ти, в принципі, і більше, крім цього, сьогодні вночі нічого не хочеш
Під обгорткою друг, який поруч
І йому не потрібно від тебе ні бабок, ні вигоди
Він просто сидить і просто мовчки просить тебе: «Брате, виживи»
І ти виживеш, бо відмовити такому другу — то є тупо не ввічливо
І ти виживеш, бо крім того, як вижити, вам сьогодні вночі зайнятися нічим
Під обгорткою люди, яких ти раніше вважав слабкими, чужими
Але вони в один день поклали на всі звичні режими
І стали країною одержимими, скаженими, навіженими мрійниками
Які з посмішками дивляться в жерла
Ворог приніс зброю і ланцюги — і нічого, ми зробимо все, щоб він жер їх
Невже мені треба була війна, щоб стати людиною, скинути лишнє?
Виходить, що так, тому за подарунок дякую Всесвіту чи Всевишньому
Чи тому підарасу, якого скоро ми привселюдно на площі знищимо
Бо сьогодні десь у бомбосховищі народилася Україна нова, і вона буде вічна
В центрі Європи сьогодні, за день до весни, відбувається диво
Криваве, страшне, в цьому диві немає нічого красивого, милого
Але в ньому є люди, поруч з якими ми живемо і, якщо треба, загинемо
І то буде честь, тож давай
Якщо війна — подарунок, ми його приймемо стійко
А ви дивіться, як Україна показує приклад
Ви так можете теж, бо якщо не зможете — зло переможе і нам буде прикро
Але такого не буде: ми зможемо, виживем, вивезем, вистоїм
І хай свідком цього стане кожен снаряд, який просто зараз падає на моє місто"

Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes, I wonder which one'll be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge

[Chorus]
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge

[Verse 2]
She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife

[Pre-Chorus]
And she looks so pretty
Drivin' in your Benz
Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge

She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends

Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough

While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine
Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents
I'm on my vigilante shit again

I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even

En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style
I'd like to try your Wu-Tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!

[Verse 1: Logic]
Ayo, ayo, Wu-Tang forever, who rhyme better?
We too clever, the boom bap's back, harder than ever
R.I.P. O.D.B, comin' through like Killa Bee
Ever since I heard Enter the 36 in '93
You cannot defeat my Wu-Tang style, I leave 'em all dismembered
Fuck a mumble rap, that shit won't never be remembered
Not even a contender, no, pretender, best surrender
My agenda is killin' shit, they feelin' this (Sinatra)
Yeah, we live and thorough
Assassinatin' every single muthafuckin' borough
From Staten to Brooklyn to Queens, the Bronx and Harlem
All the way to Maryland, yeah, we comin' for all 'em
Bobby Tarantino to the Digital
My shit is pivotal, smokin' chronic, no medicinal
Who you know assemble the Clan like Voltron?
The one and only Logic, the God, the don, I'm gone


[Break: Ghostface Killah]
Ay-yo, Logic, what up?
We gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!
Guess who stepped in the room
It's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more cake
Intelligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes
Guillotine your head, last scene in the showcase
Push weight, this Colgate, tre-eights and old gates
Exfoliate those we most hate, we don't associate
We wear robes that you can't even pronunciate
We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate
Cribs where the floor just rises up and rotates
Locations low-key, can't even locate
Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates
Team makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Yo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades
It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge
57 MB, yo, metallic green, seats is piped off
Seize 'em old tracks, unite through 'em
The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on
While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on
I'm known to wil’ out, put the cams on
Jewels down, the sets dip, my gems got grams on
A specialist when I'm bakin'
Rhymes be comin' out, we makin'
We challengin' these chumps for lumps
Here's the statement—stop hatin'
The crew is all about gettin' this cake in
You know about me, you relatin'


[Verse 4: RZA]
The enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA
Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures
Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers, and beer drinkers
Prince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers
Cake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin
Huggin' all four boroughs, puffin' herb with my cousin
Academically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'
I felt it comin' like The Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'
Sporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin
III-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten
The travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted
Diluted, broken down to a catastrophe
But cats still get the trophy, hit y'all with that ""Okie-dokie""
Burt Reynolds, Bandit, goddamnit
Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one?
I got a light-beam gun
I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from
But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery
My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity
You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me
Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry

[Verse 5: Method Man]
Old school on this track, I feel invincible
This new school ain't really got rules and lack the principles
Got more clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical
The gun, Smokey Robinson, you need a Miracle
Go back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical
When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals
Y'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable
Witty unpredictable torture over your physical
Struggle bar, used to pour water over the cereal
Another bar, reppin' my squad, not individual
But one Nation under God, that's indivisible
My time critical, hands off I'm digital
Me and my Ladybug, back when the planet was Digable
I'm cool like that, my cash rule like that
I'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on


[Verse 6: Inspectah Deck]
It's only Logic, we got 'em mobbin' in the mosh pit
Fifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics
The hot shit I drop quick
Major player, watch my stock lift
Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what
Sound boy, turn that music up
Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up
Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy
Everything circulate back around eventually
Witty unpredictable, talent all-natural
Game, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins
Twenty-five years, still more of the same
The flow like water with the boilin' flame
INS, your highness, they callin' my name
Boy, I wet the scene similar to fallin' rain
In our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same
Tell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain

[Verse 7: Cappadonna]
Survival of the fittest be cold days with no money
They don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me
You know the currency gone soon as you break a twenty
So I ain't down if you ain't talkin' that band language
Dear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it
An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it
But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it
I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger
We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger
Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves
I know your momma told you that I was a great dude
These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you
On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you
What? What, what? They might Crystal in the Lake you

[Verse 8: Jackpot Scotty Wotty]
Boom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off
Our Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off
Smoke and roast ya, the No. 9 Potion
Pull that shit, son, we open the ocean
Who gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'?
You get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'
That's another level of emotion
Food stamps niggas doin' grocery
Police wanna grope me
Perp walk, then nigga street-talk
We bury niggas in sea salt
I carry the torch where I leave off
I'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on
I rip off a shoulder to lean on
It's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains
And none of my rhymes is two and the same
Nigga get cooked on a open flame
I'm a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained

[Verse 9: U-God]
Check it, uh
My rhyme starts riots in the mountains
Thirty-six million and countin'
The harder they come, the harder I go
Loosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?
Stay on my tip-toes, old-school Wu beat
This is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'
Where I come from it stays snowin'
The grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door
Beez bang bong in your jaw
I hit 'em in the head with the hammer of Thor
Stars and bars, makes me a general
Anything less, makes me a criminal
Gotta dig deep for these Wu-Tang minerals

[Verse 10: Masta Killa]
G.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C
On the count of three, Wu-Tang
First, master your breathin'
I'm mental ass-whoopin', I'm teachin' when I'm speakin'
I'm a champion from Brooklyn
I'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners
Avenger, a righteous defender
Grandmaster from the 36th Chamber
Toad style is mentally strong, so strengthen your arms
To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, Jamel Irief
Wise chief, Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

[Verse 11: GZA]
Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning
Regardless, I speak logic—clear reasoning
The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas

[Break: Cappadonna]
(Sinatra) (Wu-Tang)
W.T.C., ah-ha
The faculty
Ain't nothin' goin' on, don't nothin' move
Nobody slide, nobody get hurt

[Outro]
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu tang style
I'd like to try your Wu tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu Tang sword can defeat me?"

Ти знаєш мої сни до хвилин
Але не знаєш, хто я
Ти наче мій власний дзен
Що плавитись у пеклі звик
Ти спотворений вбивця
І ти один мій рятівник

Ти мій оголений нерв
І ти моя сила
Ти біль моїх загиблих дерев
І ти мої крила
Ти мить, у якій я злякалась
Але страх уже зник
Ти спотворений вбивця
І ти один мій рятівник


У думках твої шалені очі, як вікна в забуття
У руках майже нічого, крім безмежного життя
У думках твої шалені очі, як вікна в забуття
У думках - ти, як останній теплий день, а я зима

Ти один
Ти один мій

Кілька років ходжу на психотерапію
Думала, що вже не поведусь на ці дитячі ігри
Та ти такий безжальний і токсичний
А я так звикла заслуговувати любов
Хата, ніч, бухло і ти
І горять-горять, і горять мости
Нехай дивляться сусіди, фіранок нема
На ранок не згадаю навіть ім'я
Я ж така недоторканна, сталева і складна
То чому ж завтра тріщатиме моя голова?

Бухло і квартира за межею міста
В ній так гаряче і тісно
Так гаряче і тісно!

Нам так гаряче і тісно за межею цього міста

[Куплет 2]
Я присягалась
Що мені більше не треба нічого такого
Обіцяла
Собі ж не їздити до лівих чоловіків додому
І що? Де я проснулась сьогодні?
Хоча, чому я дивуюсь?
Для мене цілком природньо
І я знову відпускаю себе
Пляшка ванільної горілки
Не вистачає тебе, що ж
На жаль, я пам'ятаю твій номер
Я пам'ятаю навіть номер твого дому, тому
Знову

You wouldn't wonder why you hear

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare

And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

You're tuned to Dawn FM
The middle of nowhere on your dial
So sit back and unpack
You may be here a while
Now that all future plans have been postponed
And it's time to look back on the things you thought you owned
Do you remember them well?
Were you high or just stoned?
And how many grudges did you take to your grave?
When you weren't liked or followed, how did you behave?
Was it often a dissonant chord you were strumming?
Were you ever in tune with the song life was humming?

If pain's living on when your body's long gone
And your phantom regret hasn't let it go yet
You may not have died in the way that you must
All specters are haunted by their own lack of trust
When you're all out of time, there's nothing but space
No hunting, no gathering, no nations, no race
And Heaven is closer than those tears on your face
When the purple rain falls, we're all bathed in its grace
Heaven's for those who let go of regret
And you have to wait here when you're not all there yet
But you could be there by the end of this song
Where The Weeknd's so good and he plays all week long
Bang a gong, get it on
And if your broken heart's heavy when you step on the scale
You'll be lighter than air when they pull back the veil
Consider the flowers, they don't try to look right
They just open their petals and turn to the light
Are you listening real close? Heaven's not that, it's this
It's the depth of this moment, we don't reach for bliss
God knows life is chaos, but He made one thing true
You gotta unwind your mind, train your soul to align
And dance 'til you find that divine boogaloo


In other words
You gotta be Heaven to see Heaven
May peace be with you"

Pero en la ensenada mágica, hay una chica bonita
Le pregunto a dónde va, porque de veras quiero
Me pregunto si sabe que estamos bajo agua
Así son las cosas en esta maravilla de ciudad

[Verso 1: Bootie Brown]
Me fui al lugar, soy uno de los pocos
Mucho de todo, pero nada que hacer
Tumbado en el Tesla, perdona al exluchador
Él sale con Francesca, han tomado Xannies
Liposucción prevista para la abuela
Ella quiere ahorrar un poco, operar su trasero
Viaje de chicas, Miami en fin de año
Cielos llenos de polución, trato de pensar claro
Escuché las malas noticias cuando derramaba una cerveza
Cuidado con los cultos, Paul Revere
Todos desempeñamos nuestro papel en la alegría del diablo
Corre hacia las colinas porque el fin se acerca

Fui con el reverendo ya que ha pasado un tiempo desde que lo vi
Estoy controlando en un rando', ella es un escándalo social
Manejamos la situación cuando es demasiado que soportar
Los chicos ABC asaltamos al alcalde
Como Shaun, es un Ryder, tomó el reto
Ahora canta como un pajarito, tomándose del pelo
Tendencia en Twitter es para lo que algunos vivimos
Amistades aquí, pero ahora es un círculo vicioso
¿Todo esto es una broma? Pauly Shore
La mierda sigue viniendo, capaz soy un matador
¿Para qué estamos viviendo?

¿Estamos perdiendo la mente?
Porque la vida se metió en el camino (Hey, hey, hey)

Вибивають з мозку лайно

Мало знаєш, мало спиш, давно куриш ради тиші
В голові не те залишив, нам потрібен лиш твій час
""Я б тебе в житті не зрадив"", відчуваю твої рани
Тож ходи-ходи до нас

Ти вбиваєш підсвідомість
Викручуєш навиворіт моє нутро
Я підкорюсь на життя, а натомість
З мосту метро полечу у Дніпро


Бо тоді настане смута і не допоможе смуга
На столі мені так нудно, інтерес до тебе згас
В бідах мариш чужі спини, проклинаєш на погибель
Тож ходи-ходи до нас

Хіба тільки війна — це те, шо об'єднало нас
Чому тільки тоді війна, коли ми прокидалися
Хіба в 4 ранку ти подумав, шо ти в силах
Прокинутись у світ, де безпека пахне сирісттю
Чому через війну почало відрізнятися
Без крові на скронях ми здавались зайченятами
Не можна бути просто нерозбірливим сусідом
З хуйлом, яке кидає в тебе кістки за обідом
Чому тільки сльози спонукають визначатись
Хто не принесе біди, а хто тільки визначається
Хіба тільки труп нам покаже, хто інакший
Хіба тільки труп може бути вчорашнім

Нарешті стало тупо бути поза політикою
Хіба через війну можна тільки померти
Яка кількість життів дарується ціною смерті
Коли ше радикальність може бути відвертішою
Коли ше раз агресор врешті точно стане жертвою
Коли ти не живий, значить не в змозі кричати
Якшо ти не збирався, — значить варто вже почати
У некрозу з'являється межа демаркації
В лімфовузлах зникають метастази окупації

В якому застрелився їх останній офіцер

I heard Fraxiom is actually a psyop from the hyperpop italian mobsters
I heard Fraxiom Music literally killed someone and they had to send helicopters
I heard Fraxiom is changing their pronouns this year, someone stop her!

It's okay for me to log off now I'm talking to DJ Re:Code (Hi)
You gossip about me, I gossip about me, I'm feelin' nasty like Rico
I'm in LA on my own accord in my own Accord but I’m eco

I'm bad mouthin' again
Kiss my ass, you got stank breath

Picking scars on my cheeks, yeah
Rotate mind in Los Feliz
I’m on my just girly things
I'll admit, happily
I don't read texts, I retweet
Can't speak for Frax, that's just me

They gotta say less, but they need to know more
But I gotta calm down, this is what I asked for and I love it
Talking shit about you, I am not above it
All your friends are cute [?], think nothing of it
I destroy you like that, but you probably love it
I suspect your hands are messy, while you know to glove it

And them thick hips

She break it down then I twist up

And I could be Alone
I'd faint

I wanna say it
I know you sick of waiting
Sick of praying
Running out of patience
He never answers but you hold him sacred
That's blind faith so behold the matrix
Who do you believe in
Do you have a reason
Through magic voodoo
They will try to fool you
No TV, Hulu
Eating ramen noodles
Blessed hallelujah
And who knew what
This shit would do
Ain't have no interview
I'm into you
Let's end the feud
Right after the interlude


You don't see but I been holding back
Tempted to do off, end it all at that
You can help me if your aim is pure
But there's no medicine
You know the cure

And I could be alone
But I faint
I'ts my fate
Woah, and I could be alone
Why wait on?

And I could be alone
But I faint

Entertainers like to seem complicated
But we're not complicated
I can explain it pretty easily
Have you ever been to a birthday party for children?
And one of the children won't stop screaming?
'Cause he's just a little attention-attractor
When he grows up to be a comic or actor
He'll be rewarded for never maturing
For never understanding or learning
That every day can't be about him
""There's other people, you selfish asshole!""
I must be psychotic, I must be demented
To think that I'm worthy of all this attention
Of all of this money you worked really hard for
I slept in late while you worked at the drug store
My drug's attention, I am an addict
But I get paid to indulge in my habit
It's all an illusion, I'm wearing makeup
I'm wearing makeup, makeup, makeup, makeup

Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident
When you're starin' into space
It's hard to believe you don't remember it
Woke up in the ambulance
You pieced it all together on the drive

I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I

In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually, I don't panic
I just wanted to be on time
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder
I didn't even think of pullin' over
I pieced it all together late that night

And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared

What if it happened to you on a different day?
On a bridge where there wasn't a rail in the way?
Or a neighborhood street where the little kids play?
Or the Angeles Crest in the snow or the rain?
What if you weren't alone? There were kids in the car
What if you were remote? No one knows where you are
If you changed anything, would you not have survived?
You're alive, you're alive, you're alive

And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In your hospital bed, I remember you said

За маму страшно, да и вообще как-то, я так устала, так хочу домой

[Кулпет 1]
Мне сегодня восемнадцать лет
Дай зажигалку и выключи свет
Некого звать, тут никого нет
Задуваю свечи под свист ракет
Я так давно бегу, что не знаю от чего
Я так молода и не знаю всего
Тебе тоже противно от себя самого

[Предприпев]
Поцелуй на прощание и дай обещание:
Мы встретимся дома, в Киеве, в мае

[Припев]
Я бы могла писать портреты, жить ради кого-то
Знать, где я проснусь завтра, и не бежать от чего-то
Делить сигареты, честно любить идиота
Спать и не бояться, не ждать конца эпизода
Я бы могла писать портреты, жить ради кого-то
Знать, где я проснусь завтра, и не бежать от чего-то
Делить сигареты, честно любить идиота
Спать и не бояться, не ждать конца эпизода


[Скит]
И я скучаю, зато, когда встретимся, тепло уже будет, не грусти

[Куплет 2]
Так много лет у меня нет дома
Вся жизнь в рюкзаке, это уже основа
Давно раскрошен мой родной город
Я кричу в пустоту, я пою глухому
Я так давно бегу, что не знаю от чего
Мне негде остаться, у меня нет ничего
Я пишу про любовь, даже когда тяжело

[Предприпев]
Забей на расстояние, я точно знаю:
Мы встретимся дома, в Киеве в мае

[Припев]
Я бы могла писать портреты, жить ради кого-то
Знать, где я проснусь завтра, и не бежать от чего-то
Делить сигареты, честно любить идиота
Спать и не бояться, не ждать конца эпизода

Шось не пишуться пісні для супермаркетів про Байрактари
Мені здається, Кашляючий Ед мене вдарить
Він іноді повертає кермо ровера на зустрічну
Шоб я з його вуст почув: ""я живий!"" — голосом Петра Моставчука
Та це вже ліпше, ніж у вишиванці Аліна Паш
Я пхаю глибше ніж в рану, шо не заживе після внуків мого сина
""Моя хата скраю"" сьогодні вже не красива
Ракета стирчить зі стелі — то моя нова люстра
Бог живе чи він помер? Ну скажи шось, Заратустра
Зараз в Тустань під Скріптоніта йобни водки з перцем
Твої в'єтнамки на пляжі натерли гірше берців
Літом війна триває теж — горе не минулось
Людина пішла від мавпи, але згодом повернулась
Я так само боюсь заслинитись перед бананом
Бо мені добре буде, лиш коли москалям погано
Поки не пізно, ліпше вирвати декілька зубів
Бажаєш смерті москалю? Тоді їбаш його в собі
Не дякуй за мову заради предків на Соловках
30 років за мітлою, а в роті — присмак совка
Який не перебив, на жаль, такий солодкий Стіморол
Ти лезо маєш? Пригадай, ми читали з Ігором
Ріж пожовкле покривало — свою меншовартість
Бо їм вже ""надо свалівать"", а нам — вже повертатись
До свідомості,  бо ми шось дуже довго пролежали
З пораненням наші діти вже співають Гімн Держави
Тож не смій казати, шо при Кучмі було добре, пацик
Або можеш повторити це при матері Гонгадзе
Моє серце нагадує велику гематому
Нині помираю, але воскресаю день по тому

But you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe

От і скінчився наш абонемент на землі

За мить від одиниць будуть тільки нулі
За мить від фотона до фатуму

Але я б хотів померти - ніколи

[Куплет 1]
Я танцюю крізь кулі

За бої на арені
Проливаючи сльози
Там не кравлі, а гради
Мої блискавки — стріли
Вони знищать всі зради

Що ти тут забув ""герой своего времени""
Ти лише гарматне м'ясно без роду та племені
Віддають приказ — ти робиш — цар вже не в голові
А в твоєму серці, яке загине та згніє в землі
Покладіть в кишеі зерна - хай хоч щось проросте
Я хочу бачити не кулі — хочу поле густе


[Брідж]
Мені бридко і гірко
Що ви так наробили
Випиваєте душу
Але мрію не вбили

Yo, hip hop is the way of life
It ain't a fad, it ain't a trend
Not for those of us who are true to it
It's reflected in our slang, in our walk, and in our stance
In our dress and in our attitude
Hip hop has a history and an origin
And a set of principles including rules and regulations
That a lot of these new kids overlook nowadays

Music itself acts as a safety valve in society
If there was no hip hop music, there would much more chaos in the streets than we have now

It's our way to release tension, to let out the frustration that young people face in the world today

Over the years, hip hop has evolved to represent what is happening now, the reality of street life
Rap is the oral expression of this
The tune, the literature
Hip hop is the lifestyle, the philosophy, and even the religion if I may
Just as jazz has had its own culture
Rap music also has had its own culture, which we proudly call hip hop
Although the music and lifestyle is now propagandized by the media
And is now exploited by big business
And will still remain for the rest of us the raw essence of life

Sí, nena, sé tú misma
Y hago esto por mi ciudad, se ha expandido, no es nada nuevo
Hablo del norte del norte, de lo más alto
Del OVO, del XO
Tu novia estará en nuestro próximo concierto
Pero no pasa nada, no te estreses
Nunca pensé tener sexo en la primera cita

Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's workin'
So what can I do? (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're out of sight
In my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

[Verse 2]
Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again


[Pre-Chorus]
When you're out of sight
In my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

[Куплет 1]
Восемь поездок на карте, один AirPods
Примерно полторы нервные клетки
Мне не хватает монет на проезд
Мне не хватает Нурофена таблетки
Обижаешь меня только во сне
Из-за тебя каждый день я просыпаюсь уставшей
Меня запомнили рыжей, кудрявой
С синей гитарой, в центре стоявшей

[Припев]
Я не знаю, кем ты был до меня
И кто тебя может сделать лучше
Но этим кем-то точно буду не я
Ведь ты сообщения мои не послушал
Можешь просто прыгнуть с окна
Сказав, что я снова отшила тебя
Пожалуйста, хватит ныть
Ну что ты, котик, я же любя

Я любя, любя (Я любя)

Вместе прошли Валенсию, значит, не вместе
Нам проходить медные трубы
Не заведем кота на пенсии
Больше утром не улыбнусь тебе в губы
Мой самолёт сильно трусит, скажи, как долетел
Скажи, как там Киев, покажи вид с окна
Я снова дома, я как будто прозрела
Пропускаю станции, остаюсь допоздна
Я не знаю, кем ты был до меня

[Припев]
Я не знаю, кем ты был до меня
И кто тебя может сделать лучше
Но этим кем-то точно буду не я

All of this attention turns the glamorous on its side

This Tentpole Shangri-La displays this paradise in new light
So mark my words 'cause they gonna be true
If you done change your insides, they'll take enemies over you

One of many faces that you stranded on the shelf
Oh, no, alright
This tentpole Shangri-La has turned me into something trite
Conflicts and complications that you made up all the time
Have all proven to be worthless, fabricated in your mind
Oh, no, I thought that's all right

Of my head, seeing stars
You said ""Come to ours""
So I did
It's a decision that I'm glad that I made
I'm still not certain that it happened at all
I just can't recall

I keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
I keep thinking, ah

[Verse 1]
Last night, I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
'Cause he always used to look at me that way
And I thought, maybe I should walk right up to her and say
""Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play""

[Chorus]
Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day, you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angel eyes
Oh no, no, no, no

Sometimes when I'm lonely, I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder, does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day, you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angel eyes
Crazy 'bout his angel eyes

He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise

Need my reparations, started with the basics

Trying to make a home by any means, no cases
Red and blue lights flash off to the races
Whole city Paisley, summertime crazy
Self-made, cause the rule of 4080
Reaching the circle twice, 4-hopping out the whip
Protection is priority, I do not plan a shit
Not even musical chairs, but I step a little bit
I ain't one for clout, chasing on the net
Seeing murder on live, they doing reps
Easy call, they depend on me, it's the bet

Впізнала – і ось тепер...

And put our arms around the ones that we need
Into the place where all the rivers will meet

The evil, it spread like a fever ahead
It was night when you died, my firefly
What could I have said to raise you from the dead?
Oh, could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?

[Chorus 1]
""Well, you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die""

[Verse 2]
Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like junior high?
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now, where am I? My fading supply

[Chorus 2]
""Did you get enough love, my little dove?
Why do you cry?
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles""


[Verse 3]
The hospital asked, ""Should the body be cast?""
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?

[Chorus 3]
""Shall we look at the moon, my little loon?
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light
Well, you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die""

Yeah, I can't do these long drives sittin' in the back seat
Thinkin' 'bout that one night when the world caught fire (You're driving me crazy)
Baby, and your eyes brightened up this dark scene
You told me I would be fine, I called you a liar (You're driving me crazy)

We just FaceTime, is this a sign? I'm fallin' out of your life
I try my hardest not to think about what I just realized
You said I was your light, I think that's just a white lie
Feelin' so rotten inside, thought I died
I kinda wanna go back, I'm missin' the pain
Of a heartbreak and life just don't hit the same
I'm havin' migrainеs, my friends all over the placе
With their lifes straight, I guess I'm afraid of growin' out of my place

You told me I would be fine, I called you a liar (You're driving me crazy)

And all I want is to (Take you by the sea)
I'll show you sights from above and take you (To my dismal dreams)
I'll see that falling stars will set your (World on fire, baby)

You're make-believe, why can't you see?
I'll make these roses all turn green

Will fall into my dreams, I'm drowning, oh (Woah)

That walk across the island
Back when I was strong
Both eyes that opened
When what I saw was true, it was true enough to feel it
Clear and hyperreal, nothing could deceive me

What a manic state
That held me in place
Or a stateless mind
And all those years alone that colored in the lines
Drawing a boundless love, reserved and unrequited
Best left unshared

[Verse 3]
Returning in waves
Slowly, slowly
A march towards the wavеs
Today I could die alone, that much I know for sure
And if I could givе to you what I had
I see it now, I see it now
Love left unshared
Back when I was strong

So rootless and out of place

But fate had left its scars upon his face
With all the damage they had done

Let the flesh
Submit itself to gravity

Let our bodies lay, mark our hearts with shame
Let our blood in vain, you find God in pain

May your ashes feed the river in the morning rays
And as the vermin crawls
We lay in the foundations of decay

And so he wandered down the road
And we would all build towers of our own

And you must build an altar where it swells
When the storm it gains, and the sky it rains
Let it flood, let it flood, let it wash away
And as you stumble through your last crusade
Will you welcome your extinction in the morning rays?
And as the swarm it calls, we lay in the foundations

He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I-I-I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Lil Wayne]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want (Oh-oh)
Put it wherever you want (Oh-oh)
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Alright)
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Uh)


[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her, ""Make me some money"", she tell me, ""Make me a wife""
I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?""
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"", she say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on somethin' tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lyin'
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself

[Verse 1: tobi lou]
I just spent two hours cryin' but how could you know that
When all you see is me smilin' like I work for Kodak?
Little things hurt like a giant
Lil Wayne, ""I Feel Like Dyin'""
But you know I can't stop tryin', I hope you know that
This shit been so fuckin' crazy, I might bring my 'fro back
Just 'cause you posted a picture it don't make you pro black (Ooh)
Can't you see that I'm just tired? Roll one up, now I'm just flyin'
When I see over horizons, don't make me go back

It's gettin' hard to hold back (So damn hard)
It's gettin' hard to hold back these tears, yeah

It's gettin' hard to hold back
It's gettin' hard to hold back thеse tears (Tears)


[Verse 2: tobi lou]
(I just spеnt two hours, I just spent two hours)

But it wasn't me
I just came out of retirement (I'm fuckin' retired)
And I just came out that bitch, firin’
Waterboy like the firemen
I'm a product my environment
I done met all the requirements
But it's gettin' hard to hold back
I just hope y'all just know that
I done took all the blow back
Black out and ball like BoJack

I went and bought a new lease
How do I deal with the grief?
She ain't see me in a week

So many lies you lie to me, to get it out of me
Say I'm disconnected when I'm not tryna be
All I ever wanted was you to try to see my side, yeah
And I know I promised you I wouldn't let it get to me
All I'm askin' is for that energy
Soon as you wake up, all you do is take up
All my time, yeah
Ooh, you gettin' started? I'll let you finish
You said you was gonna fix it
Why don't we just end it? Why do we keep pretendin'?
I want some change I can actually see with my very own eyes
It's gettin' hard

I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin and fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine and the elegant cars

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

Forget about our mothers and our friends
We're fated to pretend

I'll miss the playgrounds and the animals and diggin' up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father, miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom and the time spent alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course

In the afternoon
Yellow curtains drawn
Designed with comfort in mind
Glowering into the night
Feel like letting go
The final resting place
The house cat knows when it's time
To enter another phase

[Chorus 1]
But you looked sad
In a reassuring way
And I don't want to leave
So we can both be the same

[Verse 2]
In the afternoon
Modern sovereignty
The sunlight stopped coming through
And we lost the game
Brains like nesting dolls
Plotting their escape
The doorman sees you're alone
He can't seem to find your name


[Chorus 2]
But you, my friend
Know problems can't be solved
They don't understand
That somehow it's all the same
And somehow it's all the same
And somehow it's all the same
And somehow it's all the same

Relief is like candy
The sweetest kind of love
Who'd guess that I'd feel this way?

Знаєш, моя душа знову посміхається
Людям перехожим і тим, хто лишається
Поряд крізь дні, місяці, роки
Кого пригадаю, коли падають зірки
Хто любить, не зважаючи на гірше
Те що нас губило, не зробить нас сильніше
Ми самі обираєм свої ролі
Від кохання чи від болю

Кожен змінює світ щомиті
Ми приходим сюди любити
Як небесні вогні, коли так темно
Світять наші серця, все не даремно

Все не даремно, все не даремно
Все не даремно, все не даремно

Wish I could write songs about anything other than death
But I can't go to bed without drawing the red, shaving off breaths;
Each one so heavy, each one so cumbersome
Each one a lead weight hanging between my lungs
Spilling my guts, sweat on a microphone, breaking my voice
Whenever I'm alone with you, can't talk but
""Isn't this weather nice? Are you okay?""
Should I go somewhere else and hide my face?
A sprinter learning to wait
A marathon runner, my ankles are sprained
A marathon runner, my ankles are sprained"

You think that's not fun, day is done
With no other feelings
Why are your eyes not shining in lights?
There's more than one meaning

Just get what you want, but again you got numb. It's because of freaking illusion
That life is not fiction, the sense in the description of love, it's an awful conclusion

You could always turn it back
Get another heart attack
We roll!
We'll find ourselves in lovе

Мене до тебе притиснуло, відвернутись я не міг
І ми у позі еротічній були загнані в тупік
Інтеліґентний мужчина, український інженер
Я від викиду гормонів три зупинки чуть не вмер
Зашипіли двері, станція 'Хрещатик' –
І народ почав з вагону наче картопля випадати
Переплетені тілами, виїжджаєм з-під землі
І відчуваєм, що так просто нам не розійтися, ні
І я лечу, як метелик, забігаю в генделик
Замовляю там дві кави збудоражити уяву

І зранку знову ниряю у підземні тунелі
І несе мене до тебе ця криклива канітєль
І бачу ті самі джинси і той рюкзачок
І від радості зжимаю у кишені кулачок

And staring at you
I can't leave this place
I‘m stuck in this room

You're standing there
Feets on the floor
I hope you won't  be blown
Out of the window

Got me a fever
Owe you plenty
Now I'm holding on
Got me a fever now I'm ready
Take me to the storm

Got me a fever
Owe you plenty
Now I'm holding on
Got me a fever now I'm ready
And it comes

Frozen heart
Starts beating fast
I'm good alone
Words becoming dust


Keep in myself
It will prevent
But what i feel
It's ambient
It's ambient

Got me a fever
Owe you plenty
Now I'm holding on
Got me a fever now I'm ready
Take me to the storm

Got me a fever
Owe you plenty
Now I holding on
Got me fever now I'm ready
And it comes

And it comes
And it comes
And it comes
And it comes

Got me fever
Owe you plenty
Now I holding on
Got me fever now I'm ready
Take me to the storm

Назавжди у руці
Бо я тащусь від тебе давно
Люблю, як біле вино
Дивлюсь тебе, як кіно

Шо тебе так мила дивувало
Не сижу вже на землі фалоу мі
Я піду скрізь туди, куди ти
Раді тебе кинув все, що курив

Про принцип мій розкажуть пацики в дворі, ей

When they nod and they just don't care
You've got imagination

Better do it anyway

It's a gift, but it's always a curse
To go on without it
You caught a ride from a bad, bad heart
It's the thing that tears you apart
It's got to come from something

If it hurts to love you
Should I walk away?

The way I got you on the run, I hear you say “let’s fuck all night”
Feeling something better, I might fuck her if I’m feeling tight
Right, um, got me feeling something that I need to get that itch scratched
Turn around and give to papi, yeah I wanna
Bad bitches always have to keep their hands wet, we're too slick
I like to glide, figure skate on a bitch
Turn her out, she likes a ride - is she cute? Yeah, she might
She a baddie for the season or a baddie for the night

[Chorus]
She tore it, look at that slime
That silk smooth dutty wine
Every inch she moves what's mine
Yup, yup
She’s for the streets, bitch (And that’s fine)
She’s for the streets, bitch (Mm)

Every inch she moves what's mine

She's for the streets, bitch

[Verse 2]
She came to fuck
Tell me now if you’re looking to get down
In the back, in the front, on the highway in your truck
I don’t give a fuck, turn me up, let me hear it louder
I can never get enough, is it rough?
When you see me in the club, with the bottles turning up
I got pretty mean bitches, if you want it, try your luck
Only stunting with the A team, know you wanna touch
Bite it off, real Rottweiler bitch, in the streets when I want


[Bridge]
(Ohh, ahhh)
(Ahh-ahh)
Yeah, you can holla me
Back of the club with the Hennessy
Two shots and I'm running lean
Come pour me up

Girl, tonight we're gonna make love
You know how I know?
Because it's Wednesday
And Wednesday night is the night that we usually make love
Monday night is my night to cook
Tuesday night, we go and visit your mother
But Wednesday, we make sweet, weekly love
It's when everything is just right
There's nothing good on TV
You haven't had your after-work social sports team practice
So you're not too tired
Oh boy, it's all on
You lean in and whisper something sexy in my ear like
""I might go to bed now, I've got work in the morning""
I know what you're trying to say, girl
You're trying to say, ""Oh, yeah, it's business time
It's business time""

Then we're in the bathroom, brushing our teeth
That's all part of the foreplay; I love foreplay
A-chicka-chicka, a-chicka-chicka, a-chicka-chickow-ow-oww!
Then you sort out the recycling
That isn't part of the foreplay process, but it is still very important
Next thing you know, we're in the bedroom
You're wearing that baggy old ugly t-shirt
You got from your work several years ago
Mmm, you know the one, baby
With the curry stain, oww!
I remove my clothes very, very clumsily
Tripping sensuously over my pants
Now I'm naked, except for my socks
And you know when I'm down to just my socks
What time it is; ooh

It's business, it's business time
(You know when I'm down to my socks it's time for business

Because I'm so intense
You whisper something sexy like, ""Is that it?""
I know what you're trying to say, girl
You're trying to say, ""Aww yeah, that's it""
Then you tell me you want some more
Well, uh, I'm not surprised
But I'm quite sleepy

You ain't safe until you've lived your life with no fear
You can't live until we cry every beautiful tear
It ain't easy 'til it goes 'specially when you're sinful
Camouflage my darkest thoughts, disconnecting the ties

Things we find in there shouldn't be seen by anyone
Do what you gotta do, there's not a lot in me left

This time is the last time
'Cause I'm soft like cashmere

Falling deep in our thoughts

That's usually how it goes, like
'Cause I'm soft like cashmere

As long as we been in time like the memories
Slow it down in the centuries
I don't think I could see the future
Right at the middle we became enemies
Centimetres from telling me
That you always felt my love abuse ya
And I'm about to lose ya
I guess it never goes easier
Where's the service when you need it
So I disconnected myself (Oh no)
And when I wanted your wisdom
You just gave me a reason
To put a hole in your chest
Heartbreak Hotel, black magic spell
Can't find myself again, oh well
No. 5 Chanel, channel my inner spirit
Freedom calling, Eden calling
I could never stay
It's your mistake and I don't wanna save you

A veces, me pedías algo diferente
Odio cuando lo hiciste, desearía que no lo hicieras
Haría cosas y te enfadarías, yo
Nunca debí haberlos hecho, desearía ser diferente
¿Por qué tenemos que alejarnos ahora?
Ha pasado un año, han pasado un par de días
Desde que me llamaste diciendo que estás preocupado
Ha sido difícil para mí lidiar con este espacio ahora
Sin compañía, deseando poder sentarnos
Porque lo siento, pero no me quieres

You told me I would be fine, I called you a liar (You're driving me crazy)

I try my hardest not to think about what I just realized
You said I was your light, I think that's just a white lie
Feelin' so rotten inside, thought I died
I kinda wanna go back, I'm missin' the pain
Of a heartbreak and life just don't hit the same

With their lifes straight, I guess I'm afraid of growin' out of my place

I don't think about the future (It doesn't matter)
Or whether we'll stay together (Whether we'll part)
Making promises is dangerous (I'm just a phase)
I'm just your valentine

Can't you see that this is fading? (A love affair)
Baby, let's keep it out of our feelings (Baby, be fair)
Making promises is dangerous (I'm just a phase)
I'm just your valentine

And I don't wanna take this falling down, I'll be there
All I want is everything

I don't think about the future (It doesn't matter)
Or whether we'll stay together (Whether we'll part)
Making promises is dangerous (I'm just a phase)
I'm just your valentine

[Chorus 2]
Can't you see that this is fading? (A love affair)
Baby, let's keep it out of our feelings (Baby, be fair)
Making promises is dangerous (I'm just a phase)
I'm just your valentine

Turn to you but I hope you know

Nowhere else to go

Two hearts, I couldn't resist the charm
Wasn't right, wandering the streets at night
We tried, got me looking everywhere
Hard road
Tell me who you are
I can be the gentle boy
Caught up in the city lights
It's alright, ten minutes till the sunrise, rise, rise

[Chorus: Yves Tumor & Kelsey Lu]
I wanna keep you close, right by my side
Swear you got me hypnotized
I wanna give you every piece of me
You know you are my everything
I wanna dance into your hurricane
Blinded by your glare again
Hard road

[Verse 2: Yves Tumor & Kelsey Lu]
It was the golden age
Battered and bruised in your multicolored maze
Your mind is scattered, I've been thinking of the days
That I made progress with that sinister boy
Hard road


[Chorus: Yves Tumor & Kelsey Lu]
I wanna keep you close, right by my side
Swear you got me hypnotized
I wanna give you every piece of me
You know you are my everything
I wanna dance into your hurricane
Blinded by your glare again
Hard road"

Whoever told you
I don't care about you
Is that a friend
You should keep around you?
I tried my best
To remove all the doubts now
Our business
Is open for discussion

[Chorus]
They think you can do better
All alone
A couple strangers acting clever
Oh no
They come and go it’s temperamental
I told you so I only care about forever
I wish you the best in all your future endeavours
Let's see where this goes and find out if we end up better

[Verse 2]
Had me convinced that I knеw you best
And now you're sending paragraphs of words that camе from someone else
Why’d you have to put me to the test?
The pressure leaves the impression you're wanting something else


[Bridge]
(Yeah) And why are all your friends paranoid?
Do they not know how much that we were in love?
Hope you're not stuck with this unfillable void
Gave you my everything and now I'm left with nothing

[Chorus]
Just because they think you can do better
All alone
A couple strangers acting clever
Oh no
They come and go it's temperamental
I told you so I only care about forever
I wish you the best in all your future endeavours
Let's see where this goes and find out if we end up better"

Knock you down two times, get up twice as fast

So, when you don't see me, how can he? (I'm sorry)
Too many still movin' uncanny (Movin')
And I already got my speech for the Grammy's

When you rich and it seems so peaceful
But more money, more problems, more evil
I can't lose, with a cloak of disguise
Life is great if you rose with the skies

Uncertain if a man sheds his soul when he cries
Not sleep and it's four, goin' on five
Now jottin' thoughts and it's all exercise

I wanna be better with emotions
Plan it out and not move so impulsive
Nerves got me shaking
They say it cure it with age, but I think they're mistaken
While some it's flagrant, I say it took patience
Long nights alone, coped with no motivation
Drunk by myself with no way to escape what
I'm faced with, evasive and spacious
Sucker nigga tryna stunt my creations
On the path, adversaries observed what it took
How to get a grip with high intelligence
I ain't always have a job
And the money got so scarce, so we robbed
They misunderstood, they thought
This was a gimmick or a fraud
Such a rapport for the boy been premature
But he still evolved, through the trenches and the fog, uh
They ignored us, who could paint these pictures with the sawdust?
Anything this vivid takin' four months
I can't lose, I get too invested in it (No)
How could this be love if there's no obsession in it? (No)
How could this be definite with no profession it?
How it feel to hear that you the best, but you been questionin' it?
When these things don't matter, gotta shake it off (Shake it off)
If the game too hot, you gotta take it off (Take it off)
If nobody wants to share, you gotta take it all (Take it off)
No bad moves, I can't lose, I never take a loss"

[Refrão: JID]
Empurra a porra do pacote pra fora da varanda ou quebra um quilo
Pega essa alça, se acontecer de precisar atirar, ela faz muito barulho
Uma vadia no meu colo, viro pra trás e vou pra cidade
Tô colocando o rap nas minhas costas, sou negro e tô roubando coroas

[Verso 1: JID]
Eu voltei igual um cara que vende crack por quilos
Eu tenho muita grana agora, mas não é nada pra me gabar
Barulho de tiro no fundo
Eu sou um homem negro com os cães de caça
MAC-10, fazendo sons de amor
Pra uma mina gostosa, ela é de Uptown
Eu sou do sul, não sou um falastrão
Podemos brincar por aí (Woah, merda, woah)
Coloca a música, baby, para com isso (Woah, merda, woah)
Acendo um baseado еnquanto você me chupa sem parar
Eu sinto que vou gozar agora (Woah, woah, mеrda, woah)
Eu me sinto como um relógio cravejado quando eu brilho
Esses caras cegos estão em alta agora (Woah, merda, woah, merda)
Em casa, SUV preta grande, o pacote foi enviado
Você pode pegar agora, mano, foda-se, ok (Ayy)

Eu e o meu dinheiro nos apegamos emocionalmente
Eu pego a arma se você chegar muito perto de mim
Eu tô no topo onde eu deveria estar
Pulei no jogo, esses caras agem como se tivessem me treinando
Quatrocentos mil não são nada, mas é um show pra mim
Eu tô na estrada e aposto que a sua mina tá comigo
Quando eu tô no trânsito, eu tô sempre armado
Sou um cara de Pillsbury, eu ando com o dinheiro comigo
Pego ela por trás
Ela me chupa e eu nem abaixo as minhas calças
Pulo na caixa e deslizo pro outro lado, um homem sempre morre
Se abaixa, mãos pro alto, mano
Faça um movimento, seja morto com tiros
Tô arrumando treta por tanto tempo
Eles nem querem mais conversar, eles só correm agora
Sem portas trancadas, eu sirvo com um fuzil
A vadia foi morta, ela tava saindo com um inimigo
Chamamos ele de Mickey, ele fala com a polícia
Eu tava em Pinedale, vidro na meia
Antigamente, eu invistia no quarteirão
O tempo passou, agora eu tô investindo em ações
Eu coloquei um tambor na Heckler e Koch
Não brinque comigo, porque eu tô muito investido em tiros

O JID tá na parte de trás se você estiver procurando pela droga
Esses caras colocam isso no saco, porque a gente trafica no quieto
E eu sou foda com o flow, huh
Me fala uma piada, ouviu um cara dizer que você é o próximo? Não, não, não
Eu sou o melhor, fala pra eles pararem com a porra da imprensa
Para com a pressão, foda-se a lista do top cinco
Dá um colete pra eles, eles ficam desequilibrados
Foda-se a polícia, estávamos fugindo de Rottweilers
A maioria dos meus parceiros não tem pai, só uma camisinha estourada, dois filhos com Alzheimer
.40 do lado dele, garoto, você é o Mike Alstott, ele tá no quarteirão violento
Roubando os caras no bairro e depois trocando os gêneros
Luz verde, se alinhe, para de dar sinal pra ele
Continue dirigindo, você não vai encontrar ele
Eu sou, eu sou, eu sou uma-eu sou uma anomalia, eu me transformei em um rapper de forma irônica
E levanto a grana, pra trás, os caras estão em cima de mim
Esses caras deveriam me honrar
Se você acha que eu sou um aspirante, é muito engraçado
Eu sou melancólico e legal, então calmamente faço movimentos
As minhas verdades carregam velocidade
A mesma posse desde a OshPosh B'gosh, coágulo de buceta
Trato o rap como se eu tivesse vendendo pedra
No fogão com o frasco de Pyrex
A porta fica trancada, diz, não bata
Estamos no quarteirão deles, dominamos tudo
São jogos de Monopoly, roubamos as suas propriedades
Falando suavemente e andando na lua
Os mesmos moleques do lago pequeno, mas com um tubarão na piscina
Eu aponto, arma grande, bato, o giz tá fora das bolas de sinalização
Atiro essa merda

Everybody 'round me sayin' I should relax, 'cause
I've been goin' hard 'til my eyes roll backward
All I wanna do is forget about my past, and
Smoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'
Probably 'cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back, but
I'ma let it slide 'cause my niggas too violent
Shout-out to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the motherfuckin' soundtrack
Then I play it back on that eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic

[Part II]
[Verse 3]
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long, I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones and
Probably not if my niggas round them up and
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep


[Outro]
This ain't nothing to relate to
And this ain't nothing to relate to
And this ain't nothing to relate to

Again (feat. Tyler, the Creator) (Traduzione Italiana) Lyrics[Strofa 1: The Weeknd]
Mi metto in posa con la mia famiglia
Sulla prima pagina dei manifesti
Giacca e cravatta e un sigaro che fuma
Shot di Macallan finché la gola non brucia
Stiamo ancora celebrando il Super Bowl
Il catalogo sembra leggendario
L'anello si è gelato come fosse febbraio
XO, è un mercenario
Un quarto di miliardo in un anno fuori servizio
Cantavo nei loft
Ma ora navighiamo su uno yacht, ci liberiamo, sì
Hai detto che volevi ingelosire il tuo ragazzo con un paio di foto
E non ti aspettavi di innamorarti di me una volta preso questo cazzo
La città è oscura, la città è pericolosa
La tua ragazza sta cercando di farti stare con qualcuno di più famoso
Ma invece sei finito con qualcuno così semplice, senza volto
Qualcuno per scattare le tue foto e incorniciarle
E la mia nuova ragazza, è una star del cinema
La mia nuova ragazza, è una star del cinema
L'ho amata proprio, l'ho fatta urlare come Neve Campbell
Ma quando la faccio ridere, giuro che cura i miei pensieri depressivi
Perché piccola, è una star del cinema
Piccola, è una star del cinema
Mi sono detto che non mi sarei più innamorato
Ma ci risiamo


[Ritornello: The Weeknd]
Ooh
Ci risiamo ancora
La vita è un sogno
Perché non è mai come sembra
Ma preferiresti amare e perdere con le lacrime
Di non amare mai affatto
Quindi eccoci di nuovo

[Strofa 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Anche se questo amore è forte per me
Alcune cose possono cambiare, andare storto con me
Non sappiamo come sarà
L'eternità è troppo lunga per me
Non abbiamo bisogno di coinvolgere il governo perché ci piace il nostro tocco
Non abbiamo bisogno che nessuna dannata religione ci dica che siamo innamorati
Ma se ci investissimo lungo la strada, aumenteremmo le paghe degli avvocati
Carta e penna mi salveranno il culo se questi sentimenti si congeleleranno
Firmerai questo prematrimoniale, firmerai questo prematrimoniale
Firmerai questo prematrimoniale, firmerai questo prematrimoniale

Ooh
Ci risiamo ancora
La vita è un sogno
Perché non è mai come sembra

Always dressed in black tie with white guys
Naked in the sunshine, to tan lines

No reply, the smoke high on the avenue
You and I
Know that you're not gonna leave it anyway
Pick me up

Can you fly
Higher than a hawk flies in a black-star sky?

Now I feel like dressing up

Night after night, we say our goodbyes
My love drips in red out of my mind at the edge of the sky
You feel your heart break and you don't know why
You're somebody else, somebody new

So sick of swimming, I'm in over my head
No wrong or right, I know it's true

Better conversation, with no limitation
Got no time to play it like a station, ayy

Taste of you, give a nigga déjà vu
Welcome back I feel like Ma$e did too, true
Hallelujah to the sky, feel like I died and went to Heaven

Don't know what I wanted, I have a memory
Back at that party, I was all over her
We didn't make out or do anything
I just remembered, I was lonely

It's just something, I got used to it
Every stranger makes me feel safer
And every person seems more beautiful"
1295,Romance,Ex:Re,"33 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsRomance Lyrics[Verse 1]
And in the night, it was a drunken stutter
Started as a next to nothing conversation
And then he's tearing me out
Taking me apart at my friend's house
I was uncomfortable, I was hurt
Still with blue innocence in his eyes
I felt my reasoning was harsh

[Verse 2]
With every stab wound and exhale, I promised myself
That I would never lose my youthful fears of grown up men
I'm scarred with cruel intentions
I thought of another the whole time
Who would have never stared me like that
See, he saw me as a human
This one thinks I'm a slaughterhouse

[Pre-Chorus]
He pretends that he's understanding
And you know in the grand scheme of everything
He's probably called a nice man
Or an ordinary kind of man
Or a stereotype with strong hands, I'm so sad
At how little joy I realized within my time with my ex guy
Before these statues arrived


[Chorus]
Romance is dead and done
And it hits between the eyes on this side
The grass is dead and barren
And it hurts between my thighs on this side

[Verse 3]
I could begin to open up and risk desire
For I move slower and quieter than most
I grew up too quick and I still forgive too slow
Oh, I wish there was another way

[Chorus]
Romance is dead and done
And it hits between the eyes on this side
The grass is dead and barren
And it hurts between my thighs on this side

[Bridge]
See me here, meet me here
I don't care if it's not repeated
I want to know who you are
For every second we outrun the moon, dread the sun come up
I want to know who you are
So I don't have to check my stuff's still here when you're gone
I want to know who you are
I want to know who you were


[Chorus]
Romance is dead and done
And it hits between the eyes on this side
The grass is dead and barren
And it hurts between my thighs on this side

And a really, really bouncy butt
All the kids are prancing, laughing, dancing
Getting their ducks in a row
It's gonna be a big night with halogenic lights
And a super-duper-ific glow

Strike a bolt of lightning and become a super freak

But I don't really care 'cause I got purple hair

Холод внутри заставляет больше полюбить себя

No guts
No glory
Same old figure
But different story
Can't believe
I bought what you sold me
Just a little more
Stands before me
So I run

[Chorus]
Who are you, baby?
Who are you keeping around?
I'm changing places
So I can't see you anymore
Who are you, baby?
Will I know your fate?
In a locked box
In a locked drawer
Will I find me an
American girl
American girl

Follow the leader
Bit the apple
Mastered the teacher
Broken shackles
Hang in the breezes
Heavy hearted
And hardly breathing
I just run (Just run)

Who are you, baby? (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Who are you keeping around? (Around, around, around, around)

Take my hand

Makes me feel like flying-ing-ing-ing

Some day down the road, I hope to be your Romeo
I'll climb the wires to your landline
While you're crying on the telephone
And you're sitting, feet dangling
Cheeks so rosy red and saying
""Baby, I was so upset, I thought you'd never set me free""
(""Hello?"")

[Chorus]
I'd say, ""Oh, I love you"" to my Juliet
""If you only knew, I'd kill for you
I am for you
I am just who you need me to be
Let's get down and let's grow old
This fire escape is getting cold
I love that dress, I love the rest
Of all that you've got going on""

[Verse 2]
One day when the lines have all been read and memorized
I hope you mean it when you say that
I am yours and you are mine
See me down here, on my knees
I'm begging, won't you marry me?
I love that dress, I love the rest
So Julie let the show go on


[Outro]
But how do you know?
Is it just something hitting you?
Do you remember a bit of ""Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"" now?
Yes (Look, just do a bit for me)
No (Why not? I don't, I don't mean, I don't mean an acting bit)
I mean, just the words
Um (Look, my babe, it's done so many times)
Oh, for goodness sake
Alright, do another bit, any bit
Um
Um, oh, God, I have an ill-divining soul"

I'm a little late, ah-ah, ah-ah
Get you water for the wait, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 1]
I dabble in the past, yeah, I said it
I finally admit it
I told you it was over, then I skinny-dipped and did it
I should've known better, but I didn't overthink it
And I probably would've floated, but I sank it
Took a dive in the deep and forgot to move
Swam with the fish 'til my kiss turned blue
I aired out my sheets 'cause they smell like you
I cleaned out the salt in my wounds
[Chorus]
And I'm a little late, ah-ah, ah-ah
Get you water for the wait, ah-ah, ah-ah
Take you out into the lake, ah-ah, ah-ah
Then I'll let you swim away, ah-ah, yeah-yeah

[Verse 2]
I step on every crack, give me credit
Your ego, never fed it
My legs just caught a cold and so I didn't wanna spread it
You told me if I tried to walk away I would regret it
Maybe if I didn't swim, I would've sweat it
Used to read every story 'bout me and you
Checked out your book, now it's overdue
I tried to return 'cause I'm over you
I cleaned out the salt in my wounds


[Chorus]
And I'm a little late, ah-ah, ah-ah
Get you water for the wait, ah-ah, ah-ah
Take you out into the lake, ah-ah, ah-ah
Then I'll let you swim away, ah-ah, yeah-yeah

[Bridge]
Acting like you know me
Instead of trying to show me
Say you praise my body
I could love somebody else
Better if I was lonely
Justified to hold me
Maybe if I was the only
Better if I would've known better

[Chorus]
And I'm a little late, ah-ah, ah-ah
Get you water for the wait, ah-ah, ah-ah
Take you out into the lake, ah-ah, ah-ah
Then I'll let you swim away, ah-ah, yeah-yeah"

Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

We filled cracks of broken homes with broken dreams and broken bones
If walls could scream, ears would bleed, you've gotta keep 'em clean
Could say it's dread but I guess it's just what made me me
Hug the world with open arms and they treat me like a pest
All the scars that I possess, you're gonna do me like this?
The charm just napalm, ticking time bomb, got Tourette's (Boom)
Surrounded by pythons, stick a sword right through their neck (Yeah)
You're fucking with templars crusading through the ends
Forbidden fruit tastes the best with no trespass on the fence (Fence)
Crawl before you walk but I've been running from this tool
Fuckery decisions, yeah, the shit that made me this cool
Life got me in a headlock, back and forth like a hockey puck
Always wanted muscles, lack of strength made me headstrong
Watch 'em crumble 'cause they sour like rhubarb
Know my cake and custard inside-out like a tube sock
I wish I was Manuka, in my mind, I can't do wrong
Still waiting for the boy B, I think it's time to move on
Brothers and sisters, pour a tea and try to oolong
Running from my struggles back and forth like the Chuckles
As morbid as it seems, I'll never wake up from this sleep
If Hell's meant for sinning, Heaven's never been for me


[Outro: slowthai & Trey Gruber]
I want to go (Brrat, brrat)
Where I should never go

I've got a sickness
And I'm dealin' with it
It feels like I'm sinking

You threw it all away and now it's over

Eh-oh
And we'll be together never, so baby, you can bite me


[Verse 2]
Don't hold your breath 'cause you're still chokin' on your words
Those things you said might be the last ones that I heard
So come pick up your clothes from the front yard
Sprinklers on, burn the rest in the backyard
Shoulda had the guts just to say goodbye
Now you're gonna have regrets for the rest of your life

I don't mind where you come from
As long as you come to me
But I don't like illusions
I can't see them clearly
I don't care, no I wouldn't dare
To fix the twist in you
You've shown me eventually what you'll do

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mind, I don't care
As long as you're here

[Chorus]
Go ahead, tell me you'll leave again
You'll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It's all the same
And I'll take you for who you are
If you take me for everything
And do it all over again
It's all the same

[Verse 2]
Hours slide and days go by
Until you decide to come
But in-between it always seems too long for certain
But I have the skill, yeah I have the will
To breathe you in while I can
However long you stay is all that I am
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mind, I don't care
As long as you're here

[Chorus]
Go ahead, tell me you'll leave again
You'll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It's all the same
And I'll take you for who you are
If you take me for everything
And do it all over again
It's all the same

[Bridge]
Wrong or right
Black or white
If I close my eyes, it's all the same
In my life, the compromise
I'll close my eyes
It's all the same

[Chorus]
Go ahead, say it
You're leaving
You'll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It's all the same
And I'll take you for who you are now
If you take me for everything
And do it all over again
It's all the same"

Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty
Yes, you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh, it's what you do to me

But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all


[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

[Verse 3]
Hey there, Delilah, you be good, and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history
Like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you

What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun
What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me

[Verse 2]
And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly
From the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be
In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me

[Verse 3]
What a curious life
We have found here tonight
There is music that sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds
Anna's ghost all around
Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees


[Bridge]
Now how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
That made your voice so smooth and sweet
But now we keep where we don't know
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With the one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name

[Verse 4]
What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun
And when we meet on a cloud
I'll be laughing out loud
I'll be laughing with everyone I see

The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stared, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

I fell in love with how you emphasize your sentences
And I got a crush on the shape of your name on my phone
Then I fell harder for your fifties movies references
And the world is smaller with you, maybe I'm not so alone
Or maybe we're alone together
Now you're packing up your bedroom on the west-side
So, I bring you breakfast and we lie on the floor of my apartment
Isn't it alarmin', it was October, January, almost July
Here's a toast to getting older, now we're young and soon we'll die

[Chorus]
Nothing lasts forever
One more weekend in the city
Break up through the summer, leave me all on my own
One more weekend can you kiss me?
Tell me that you miss me even if you won’t

[Verse 2]
I guess my memories get better with the distance
So, I made a list of all the reasons why I felt conflicted
You were teaching me to drive your parents' car around your high school parking lot
Michigan seems like a dream, but I woke up and I forgot

Nothing lasts forever
One more weekend in the city
Break up through the summer, leave me all on my own

'Cause I saw you 'cross the campus and I wished it wasn't over
And I know you're late to class, but can I take back every single thing I said?
If we just had one more weekend, could we try it all again?

To make it all better
Ripped up my old love letters
Tick tock, you got me fed up
Used up your chances, held my heart for ransom
And now a new man treat me better than you did
Get my pussy wetter than you did
You know it could have been you and me

Love moves through me
And into the abyss

It's starting to fly
See how the hands go
Waving goodbye
And you know I get so forgetful
When I look in your eyes

Through a parade
And I'm stuck in the shadow (Stuck in the shadow)
Blocking the shade
And there ain't no way to sweep up (Ooh)
The mess that we've made

She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed
Flowers for the sick and dead
She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow
She'll turn to stone at hospitals and funeral homes
And when the fog rises
Somebody sighs who is not in disguise anymore

There's nothing to keep you (Nothing to keep you)
From falling in love
It starts at the bottom (Starts at the bottom)
And comes from above
Like pieces of a puzzle
Like a hand in a glove

She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed
Flowers for the sick and dead
She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow

І наче стала хотіти
Тобі не лишиться вже нічо-

Вийду до сонця
Скину свої чоботи
Заховаю спогади
Де моє нічого
Вийду до сонця
Скину свої чоботи
Заховаю спогади
Де моє нічого

Починаю рухатись за вітром
Щоб відчути, де мій новий шлях
Знаєш, не варто очі ховати, тише ковтати досить
Я вже забула, де загубила весь свій старий досвід
І наче стала хотіти

It's somewhere lost
Forever more
My demons come for me
When they hear my voice
Ooh you
La da da da da
Oooh

Avoid some day
Smoke with you the other day
We can love (love) oh
I really wanna talk to you
I really wanna talk to you

Avoid some day
Smoke with you the other day
We can love oh
I really wanna talk to you
I really wanna talk to you

How can I talk to you?
I caught your eye across the room
Do we even need the truth for now
How can I talk to you
Our loving we should resume
I'm floating off your perfume"

هذا العالم قد يؤلمك
يجرحك بعمق ويترك ندبة
الأشياء تنهار، لكن لا شيء يُكسر مثل القلب
ولا شيء يُكسر مثل القلب

[المقطع الأول]
سمعتك في مكالمة الليلة الماضية
نحن نعيش ونموت بالأكاذيب الجميلة
أنت تعلم ذلك، أوه، كلينا نعلم ذلك
تلك السجائر التي تعالج همومنا
ذلك المنزل المحترق، ليس هناك ما تبقى
الدخان يعم، كلينا نعلم ذلك
لدينا طول الليل لنقع في الحب
ولكن تماماً هكذا، أنفصلنا
نحن محطمين، نحن محطمين

[ما قبل اللازمة]
مم، لا شيء، لا شيء، لا شيء سينقذنا الآن

[اللازمة]
حسناً، هناك صمت محطم
بواسطة الرعد الضارب في الظلام (يضرب في الظلام)
وهذه الأغنية الحزينة
يتم تشغيلها مرارًا وتكرارًا في الحانة (يتم تشغيلها في الحانة)
هذا العالم قد يؤلمك
يجرحك بعمق ويترك ندبة
الأشياء تنهار، لكن لا شيء يُكسر مثل القلب
ممم، و لا شيء يُكسر مثل القلب


[المقطع الثاني]
سنترك بعضنا ببرودة، تمامًا كالثلج
ومنتشين و جافين،
رياح الصحراء تهب، إنها تهب
أتذكر ما قلته لي؟
كنا مخمورين بالحب في تينيسي
وأنا مازلت أتذكره، كلينا نعلم ذلك

يجرحك بعمق ويترك ندبة

If all our life is but a dream, fantastic posing greed
Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
For diamonds do appear to be
Just like broken glass to me
And then she said she can't believe
Genius only comes along in storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love

[Chorus]
Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

[Verse 2]
The ink is running toward the page, it's chasing off the days
Look back at boat feet and that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me
Through playful lips made of yarn, that fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world's a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home


[Chorus]
Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

Can I believe you?
Can I
Ever know your mind?
Am I handing you mine?
Do we both confide?
I see it, eat through every word I sow
See what you need to, do you doubt it's yours?
Now I’m learning the ropes
Never get this close
I've been wounded before
Hasn't let me go
It never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face
If I don’t, well, nothing will change
Staying under my weather all day
Can I believe you when you say I'm good?
I didn't need to when I wished you would
No, it isn't enough
Never held that much
Now another way up
Been a row too rough
It never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face
If I don't, well, nothing will change
Staying under my weather all day


Lately, I'm wondering too
What type of desire I can break
When I'm one way with them, one with you
What half is it of me rearranged?

Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?
I want to need you
I want to need you
Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?"

To tell me what to do, mm-mm

Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own

I was tired of my lady
We'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read

[Chorus]
If you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape

[Verse 2]
I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad


[Chorus]
Yes, I like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape
[Verse 3]
So I waited with high hopes
And she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said, ""Aw, it's you""
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said, ""I never knew""

[Chorus]
That you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
And the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for
Come with me and escape


[Chorus]
If you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape

Yes, I like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain

Alors c'est pas gentil de faire mal aux animaux et aux insectes, car ce sont nos amis
Ainsi que les arbres, il faut leur faire des grands câlins et leur dire qu'ils sont beaux
Et qu'on les aime car c'est grâce à eux qu'on respire quand même
Et pareil pour la mer s'il vous plait, arrêtez de la polluer et de jeter vos sacs-plastiques
Car les petits animaux mignons de l'océan s'étouffent avec des pailles comme les tortues et les corails
Je n'aime pas ça, c'est pas très gentil car le monde est beau et c'est la vie

J'ai trop de peine, un jour il n'y aura plus d'enfants
J'ai trop de peine, quand je me baigne dans la mer
J'ai trop de peine, quand je vois tous ces problèmes
J'ai trop de peine car la vie je l'aime
J'ai trop peine, où sont passés les baleines ?
J'ai trop de peine, alors j'écris un poème
J'ai trop de peine, quand je me baigne c'est la merde
J'ai trop de peine, quand je vois tous ces problèmes

L'huile de palme va tuer les petits orang-outang mignons de la jungle
Je les vois ils me font des grands sourires et ils m'aiment et je leur fais des petits coucous
Pourquoi à l'école on n'apprend pas à respecter la jungle, la forêt et la terre, les montagnes et les océans
C'est comme notre petit Dieu vivant, alors je dis aux adultes et aux enfants
Il est temps de changer maintenant avant qu'on périsse tous dans cinquante ans
Même si on finira un jour tous en cendres
Tous ensemble nous sommes
Nous sommes, nous sommes l'amour et la peine

C'était tellement bien de danser et de chanter en se baignant dans les rivières
L'autre jour à la plage il y avait des mégots de cigarettes
Dans le sable c'était sale, on les a ramassé jusqu'au dernier
Il y avait encore un oiseau mazouté
Putain j'ai même pas dix ans j'ai plus droit aux batailles d'eau
Le monde a changé on va tous se faire griller par la «5G»
Maintenant, on bouffe de la viande clonée et des légumes qui sont trafiqués

Добре, тож ті грішні шльондри випробовують мене, вони випробовують мене
Ось Мартін Лютер Кінг у клубі, його підбадьорюють
З лихою сукою на вухо, яка каже, що згодна на все
В глибині душі він думає про свою Коретту


[Приспів: J. Cole, J. Cole & Amber Coffman]

І я знаю, що вона знає, я знаю, що вона знає
Глибоко всередині, вона знає, вона знає

Не можу бути тим, кого ти від мене хочеш, добре, гаразд

[Куплет 2: J. Cole]
Буду проклятий, якщо зроблю, буду проклятий, якщо ні
Я відмовляюся від поганих шльондр
Намагаючись бути тим чоловіком, якого вона хоче, чого вона хоче?
Чого вона... Чого вона хоче від ніґґа?
Щоб одягнув каблучку
У мене зараз сучка на члені
І вона просто хоче на ньому «заспівати»
Підняла мене так високо, намагаючись урвати шмат того яблучного пирога
Я був так високо, намагаючись урвати шмат того яблучного пирога
Танцювальна атмосфера, мої штани палають
Бо я сказав їй, що спав, бо я
Підкрадаюся до цієї привабливої молоденької штучки, яку я обрав
Гадаю, вона могла б робити те ж саме

Одне погано в зірках — вони вигоряють

[Spoken Word: Kanye West]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder


[Verse: Kanye West]
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say ""He died so young""
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay
We was all born to die, nigga, DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (Ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay"

I am grey, still on the page
Oh, colour me in
Just an outline, sketchy but fine
Oh, colour me in
If green is chasing the hills over miles
If blue is pursuing the sky
See if the red of your heart doesn't mind
Where you begin to colour me in

[Verse 2]
Something new and nothing to do
Then I'm just the idea
I must be real 'cause somehow I feel
That I'm just the idea
Let's share the blue of the towering sky
The green of the hills that roll by
Leave the red of your heart to decide
If you cannot choose which colour to use

[Chorus]
I'll always wait
It's never too late to colour me in
To colour me in
Today or next year, I'll always be here
If you want to colour me in

I'll always wait

To colour me in, to colour me in
To colour me in, to colour me in

18, crazy, pulled up in your daddy's car
You want to, move in with me
Guess we're off to a heavy start
Should have seen this coming
From a mile away

[Bridge]
18, crazy, I know what you want from me
I know what you want from me

[Chorus]
So if you wanna piss off your parents
Date me to scare them, show them you're all grown up
If long hair and tattoos are what attract you
Baby, then you're in luck
And I know it's just a phase, you're not in love with me
You wanna piss off your parents, baby
Piss off your parents, that's alright with me

[Verse 2]
You know I'm broke, so you pulled out your daddy's card
I drink, I smoke, you ate it up from the very start
Should've seen this coming, from a mile away

I'll play your game, I know what you want from me
I know what you want from me

So if you wanna piss off your parents
Date me to scare them, show them you're all grown up
If long hair and tattoos are what attract you
Baby, then you're in luck
And I know it's just a phase, you're not in love with me
You wanna piss off your parents, baby

Listen, no, we don't need to be enemies
Ain't got tunnel vision
Vision of us in the future with a
White picket fence and eternal decisions
I almost did it, glad that I didn't
Space cakes and a Big Mac
Got my space case but I'm sure that
All my friends fake 'cause they told me that
Shit wasn't real, it was all in my head, I imagined that
False sparks
Saw them hand-in-hand standing outside of a Wal-Mart
Now I'm sitting here wondering, when did this all start?

[Chorus]
Fuck you and Jennifer, I know that you're out with her
Go pretend that you're just friends
I'll pretend that I'm not hurt
I know all the shit I heard, you can take these bitter words
Fuck you and Jennifer
Go fucking make love to her
Fuck you and Jennifer, I know that you're out with her
Go pretend that you're just friends
I'll pretend that I'm not hurt
I know all the shit I heard, you can take these bitter words
Fuck you and Jennifer
Go fucking make love to her


[Verse 2]
Rather be the girl that got away
Than be under your thumb
Don't need to spend all my time on you, not like I was in love
Not that I'm having a nervous breakdown
I'm just let down, down, down
You don't know what that's like though
To wait up, wait up all night, though
To sleep, sleep with one eye closed
I'm blessed, yo, I'm blessed, yo
Lord had some mercy on me, looks out for nobody
Spared me your treason for some unexplained reason, yeah
So, I thank you for teaching me how I can live without you
Never needin' me, I don't need you

[Chorus]
Fuck you and Jennifer, I know that you're out with her
Go pretend that you're just friends
I'll pretend that I'm not hurt
I know all the shit I heard, you can take these bitter words
Fuck you and Jennifer
Go fucking make love to her
Fuck you and Jennifer, I know that you're out with her
Go pretend that you're just friends
Thrusting in and out of her
I can see her close her eyes
While you kiss her soft and nice
Fuck you and Jennifer
Go fucking make love to her

Clean my room and pray for this
Eat my dinner, then go back to whatever finna make me rich
Whole lotta feelin' that you can't dismiss

There's a war, there's a war

[Verse 1: Little Simz]
The kingdom's on fire, the blood of a young messiah
I see sinners in a church, I see sinners in a church
Sometimes I might be introvert
There's a war inside, I hear battle cries
Mothers burying sons, young boys playing with guns
The devil's a liar, fulfil your wildest desires
Now I don't wanna be the one to doctor this
But if you can't feel pain, then you can't feel the opposite
The fight between the Yin and Yang's a fight you'll never win
I study humans, that makes me an anthropologist
I'm not into politics, but I know it's dark times
Parts of the world still living in apartheid (Thеre's a war, there's a war)
But if I don't takе this winner's flight, that's career suicide
Though I should've been a friend when your grandma died
I see the illness eat my aunt laying in her bed
I see her soul rising as her body gets closer to death

[Refrain: Cleo Sol]
Find a way, I'll find a way
The world's not over
I will make it, don't you cry
In God we trust
'Cause we're not alone


[Verse 2: Little Simz & Cleo Sol]
I need a licence to feel
Internal wounds and I'm not tryna be healed (No, I don't, no, I don't)
I sabotage what we are trying to build
'Cause of feelings I keep inside, but it's time to reveal (Reveal, reveal)
I hate the thought of just being a burden
I hate that these conversations are surfaced
Simz the artist or Simbi the person?
To you I'm smiling, but really, I'm hurting
I dedicate my life and gave my heart over twenty-something years
Left wondering how I even feel
But was it even worth it?
I bottle up and then spill it in verses
One day, I'm wordless, next day, I'm a wordsmith
Close to success, but to happiness, I'm the furthest
At night, I wonder if my tears will dry on their own
Hoping I will fulfil Amy's purpose
Angel said, ""Don't let you ego be a disturbance""
Inner demon said, ""Motherfucker, you earned this""
Like they strip you of everything you're deserving
Realise there is a prison in us, we are conditioned as fuck
Man, it's like they can't sleep till our spirit is crushed
How much fighting must we do? We've been fearless enough
All we seen is broken homes here and poverty
Corrupt government officials, lies, and atrocities
How they talking on what's threatening the economy?
Knocking down communities to re-up on properties
I'm directly affected, it does more than just bother me
Look beyond the surface, don't just see what you wanna see
My speech ain't involuntary
Projecting intentions straight from my lungs
I'm a Black woman and I'm a proud one
We walk in blind faith not knowing the outcome
But as long as we're unified, then we've already won


[Refrain: Cleo Sol]
Find a way, I'll find a way
The world's not over
I will make it, don't you cry
In God we trust
'Cause we're not alone

[Break]
Sometimes I can be introvert
Feels like, feels like, feels like I can be introvert
Introvert
Feels like, feels like, feels like I can be introvert
Sometimes I can be introvert
[Outro: Emma Corrin]
And so it begins
The base is an amalgamation of everything
Rules are not to be played by rebels
The story of never-ending
Your introversion led you here
Intuition protected you along the way
Feelings allowed you to be well balanced
And perspective gave you foresight
The top of the mountain is nothing without the climb
Only the strong will survive
Only the strong (Will survive)
Alone, but not lonely
Your truth unveils with time
As you embark on a journey
Of what it takes to be a woman"

I wanna go, I wanna leave
I need some time away from me
And this is not an apology
Apologies aren't necessary
If this is it, let this be it
I need some time to talk it out
Don't be surprised, don't be alarmed
If first impressions start to let you down

Maybe it's not your summer
Maybe it's not your year
Maybe it's not as easy for you to walk away and disappear
It feels like your ears are burning
Did someone really call your name?
Or maybe you were just daydreaming of somebody who can make your day
Maybe it's not your summer
Maybe it's not your summеr

I'm on the edge, I'm on thе brink
It took a while to walk away
Don't you forget, don't you be naive
Confusing love with a sunny day
It took a while to walk away

Maybe it's not your summer
Maybe it's not your year
Maybe it's not as easy for you to walk away and disappear
It feels like your ears are burning

No dickstraction can confuse me
Whiskey in my hip flask, nothing fruity

[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
Being a bitch is my kink
What the fuck else did you think?
Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
It's gonna hurt, it'll sting
Spitting up blood in the sink

[Chorus]
I'm crazy, but you like that, I bite back
Daisies on your nightstand, never forget
I blossom in the moonlight, screw eyes
Glacial with the blue ice, I'm terrifying
I'm crazy, but you like that, I bite back
Daisies on your nightstand, never forget
I blossom in the moonlight, screw eyes
Glacial with the blue ice, I'm terrifying

Ahora me toca a mi, cerra la boca, gil
He vuelto a revivir no sera igual para ti
Yo no voy a morir, la oportunity de poder advertir
Y saber como Cerati será para mi team
Hay mucho que decir llegó el di tutti capi decapitando el mic
Hattori Hanzo squad por el Juan por el Fran por el Wars
Se me ha vuelto un refrán he venido a bendecir
Odio los de placa desde el podio de la plaza
Con insomnio de mi casa
Observo tras mi telescopio todo lo que pasa
No camino solo somos todos una raza
Me importa un comino si te jodo o te parezco una amenaza
Soy ayahuasca, el viento avanza ya a punto de soltar mi lanza
Y tu trasca con tu danza de Dancehall ¿Que rayos te pasa?
Se que están re buenas esas wachas
Son bonitas, nene, no me meto con sus cachas
Pero verlas en videos, juntos con tus colegas
Y tus cadenas falsas hablando de dinero
Me hace pensar que te empachas
Quieren prensas las putas lauchas
Esas fuman prensa no consumen ganjah
Estoy soltando chispas y dejaste abierta las hornallas
Ven, ven, chico, observa mi equipo, criado en el rincón
Soltando sin filtro original hip hop, no solo un ritmo
Son trenes y tipos son genes de cinco, locos que mantienen el rito
Topo sostén bien el micro, no hables porquería yo no tengo nitro
Pero tengo nitro-glicerina que es muy distinto
Okey, wey, quiero que proyectes
¿Lo sientes? Yo sé que lo sientes
Hoy me chingo a todos, no podrás pararme
¿Escuchaste bobo? vengo a hacer un desmadre
Como en Canarias, me cago en tu padre
¿Comprendes Mendez? Como Sick Jacken
Compran y venden hay que apillarse
Sobran los seres que ensucian el arte
Casi que se vuelve difícil ser un Cacique
En época de crisis dame tu tabique
Te lo rompo con una bici para que te ubiques
Te propongo un cambio de psiquis ¿Vos que propones?
Lleno el barrio de graffitis del sur hasta el west
Caminan por el lodo tirando rimas por la city una y otra vez, una y otra vez, una y otra vez
Impresio-nante-mente se transmite
Mi aprecio al arte se que te lo dije
No seas necio cobarde sabes lo que eliges
Anestecio la carne con lo que predije
Nacimos siendo real, eso no se finge
Luego no me digas que no te lo dije
Activen la movida o cierren el upite
Esto es de por vida lo supe desde pibe
Soy la memoria contemplad la gloria
Respetar la historia si no crees no oigas
Si supere la fobia el rap es mi novia
No vivo parodias no vivo para odiar
Respiro maconha traspiro en los wholecars
Me inspiro la onda vine a reclamar el lugar de mi squad
Original vandals, es mejor que te corras

1424,Pyro,Kings of Leon,"31 ContributorsPyro LyricsA lot of girls are looking for a guy to define them (as a cornerstone is used to define all parts of an edifice in blueprints)

It’s annoying.. (for the guy)[Verse 1: Caleb Followill]
Single book of matches, gonna burn what's standing in the way
Roaring down the mountain, now they're calling on the fire brigade
Bury all the pictures and tell the kids that I'm okay
If'n I'm forgotten, they'll remember me for today

[Chorus]
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I

[Verse 2]
All the black inside me is slowly seeping from the bone
Everything I cherish is slowly dying or it's gone
Little shaken babies and drunkards seem to all agree
Once the show gets started, it's bound to be a sight to see

[Chorus]
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holdin' on
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I

[Bridge]
Watch her roll
Can you feel it?
Watch her roll
Can you feel it?
Watch her roll
Can you feel it?
Watch her roll
Can you feel it?


[Chorus]
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holdin' on (Watch her roll, can you feel it?)
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone (Watch her roll)
I, I"

Homegrown
Rock to the rhythm and bop to the beat of the radio
Ain't got the slang but you got the face to play the role
And you can play with me

[Verse 1]
And all the bros
Try for the courage and try for Charity's tight clothes
She's got a hat and all the hat says is 'asshole'
She'll be bobbing to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Pretty hairdos and those lipstick kisses blown, yeah, that's the right move
Make me feel like I'm the one who moves you
The only one you see

[Verse 2]
Now, take it down
And don't you let those tears quench the thirsty ground
And don't you be so scared that you can't make a sound
Make a sound for me

[Chorus]
All of London sing
'Cause England swings and they sure love the tales I bring
Those raining days they ain't so bad when you're the king
The king they want to see

Ride a longboard, foosball fates

Everyone is disconnected these days
'Cause everyone is looking at their phone
Tryna feel like they are less alone (So wrong)
And I'm here to tell them that they're wrong (So wrong)

Hello?

[Verse 1]
Didn’t make sense-
How it got to be this way
Emotions are your weakness-
That’s your greatest mistake
And just so all my friends-
Well maybe they had your back from the beginning
But you only had to do it once
You only had to make it once
You make friends with the enemies
I had to cut them off
Make peace with your past
Pay it off if you must
I thought
That maybe you were on your way
I had to move on
Because things I shoulda known I shoulda known I shouldn’t say

[Chorus]
I had to make sure-
That you are her
I had to make sure-
That you are her


[Verse 2]
Don’t look at me the same
I’m not who I was
There’s no going back
Take off from here and run
So please don’t follow me!
As I walk into the dark
Hold this pressure in your heart
I could feel it from the start and I never stopped to believe
I know I wasn’t listening
So just
Celebrate the mistake and accept the hate
And if you’ve ever felt trapped
Well I can’t relate
No one’s ever belonged
Dry your tears now
Let me take you home

[Chorus]
Make me sure-
That you are her

I had to make sure-
That you are her"

It's been a long time since I felt so sick

Эй, смотрите: он приехал

Этот парень стили и цвета
Он сияет, он сверкает
Но есть одна беда

Офисный стиляга уснёт один
Офисный стиляга не видит снов
Ведь кто-то свыше его наградил
Чувством стиля, но ему нужна любо-о-овь
Ему нужна любо-о-овь
Ему нужна любовь

Он причёсанный и стройный
Вот он открывает двери, и
Смотрят на него влюблённо
Девушки из бухгалтерии


[Предприпев]
Кардиганы и рубашки
Гардероб он только обновил
Только это всё неважно
Если в жизни нет любви

Офисный стиляга уснёт один

Ведь кто-то свыше его наградил
Чувством стиля, но ему нужна любо-о-овь

'Cause I got into my head when she's kissing your neck

And you don't understand

[Verse 2]
Stop telling me you still feel bad
'Bout how you made me fall in love and then left
Bring it up and ruin my weekend again, forgiving your regrets

[Pre-Chorus]
And you swear you love me more than anything
Want me to lie and tell you it's been easy
To watch you move on while I take care of these
Broken pieces where my heart should be

[Bridge]
Time goes so slow, walking alone
And on my way home I see you when my eyes close
We both know why you call me crying
And I hear your lies
Deep down you wanna be mine

You say you don't understand
Why I'm not talking at the party, looking angry again
(Oh woah)
But there's a pain in my chest
'Cause I got into my head when she's kissing your neck

And you don't understand

When you walk in the room
In a white bodysuit
And I say, ""Take it off""
So you tell me to watch

[Chorus]
When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
When it's deep, gets so hot
And it's so beautiful

[Verse 2]
And the TV is on
When we make love because
We get carried away
We don't care anyway

[Chorus]
When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
When it's deep, gets so hot
And it's so beautiful

[Verse 3]
Wrapped your hair in a towel
But I watch you let it down
And it's all soaking wet
As you take me in your mouth
And we stare at the street
From the back balcony
But now all I can see
Is you undressing for me


[Chorus]
When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
When it's deep, gets so hot
And it's so beautiful"

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
Rudi said it's fine
They used to do this all the time in college (If you and I get comfortable)

[Chorus]
And we're on the borderline (Ooh)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speedin' by like a train

[Post-Chorus]
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?

Will I be so in love?

Word up son, word
Yeah, to all the killers and a hundred dollar billers
Yo I got the phone thing, know I'm sayin', keep your eyes open
For real niggas who ain't got no feelings
Keep your eyes open
No doubt, no doubt son, I got this, I got this
Just watch my back, I got the front, yo
Check it out now
Word up, say it to them niggas, check this out it's a murder

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped for warfare, beware
Of my crime family who got 'nough shots to share
For all of those who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for they self in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin', like they supposed to
They come around, but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only nineteen, but my mind is old
And when the things get for real, my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothin' really, ayo Dun, spark the Philly
So I can get my mind off these yellow-backed niggas
Why they still alive? I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation
If I die, I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate, you feel a burnin' sensation
Gettin' closer to God in a tight situation now
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you


[Chorus: Prodigy, Prodigy & Havoc]
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

[Verse 2: Havoc]
For every rhyme I write it's twenty-five to life
Yo, it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguardin' my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play
I don't got time for your petty-thinkin' mind
Son, I'm bigger than those
Claimin' that you pack heat, but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears, you'll be left with one in your dome
Thirteen years in the projects—my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one, but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or am I gonna burn in Hell for all the things I did?
No time to dwell on that, 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jax, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you out of line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin', E&J got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin', diggin' my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot, kid, you know my function
'Cause long as I'm alive, I'ma live illegal
And once I get on, I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs, I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleepin', 'cause I'm creepin'


[Chorus: Prodigy, Prodigy & Havoc, Havoc]
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look (He's just a shook one), they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
(We live the life that of diamonds)
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

[Outro]
To all the villains and a hundred dollar billers
To real brothers who ain't got no feelings

Queens get the money
41st side, keepin' it real, you know

Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

І купа копійок в моїй кишені
Я просто хочу подивитися у вічі
Попасти в самий-самий центр у мішені
Знаєш, мене ти більше не вставляєш
І гуси-гуси в вирій розлетілись
І я не жив, я формував тут свою душу
Ви не схотіли
Ми з тобою на короткій
З мене спліфф, а з тебе водка
Ріхтер грає Баха на пластинці
Ще поки не їдь додому
На таксі чи своїм ходом
Твій прихід співпав з моїм приходом

[Приспів]
Ми йдемо на різні туси
І відлетіли наші гуси
Під музику, під нотки блюзу
Знімаю вже не твою блузу
Ми йдемо на різні туси
І відлетіли наші гуси
Під музику, під нотки блюзу
Знімаю вже не твою блузу
Знімаю вже не твою блузу

Знаєш, і розійшлись наші дороги
Посипалися в різні боки, як лавина
На право мої, а на ліво твої ноги
І цілого тепер моя ти половина
Знаєш, ти у цій грі мені програєш
І ми залишитись разом хотіли
Побачив очі я твої зелені в залі
І зрозумів, що наші гуси прилетіли

[Приспів]
Ми йдемо на різні туси
І відлетіли наші гуси
Під музику, під нотки блюзу
Знімаю вже не твою блузу
Ми йдемо на різні туси
І відлетіли наші гуси
Під музику, під нотки блюзу
Знімаю вже не твою блузу"
1484,Find Me,"Sigma,Birdy","25 ContributorsFind Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
We said goodbye
That's what you told me once
So many times we've made our peace
But this is love, I'll never give you up
I know you'll always come home to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a river, always running
I keep losing you
Like a fire, always burning
I'll be here for you

[Chorus]
If you're ready, heart is open
I'll be waiting, come find me
If you're searching for forever
I'll be waiting, come find me
I see you, here in the darkness
Blinding light right where your heart is
If you're ready, heart is open
I'll be waiting, come find me

Come find me
Come find me
I see you, here in the darkness
Blinding light right where your heart is
If you're ready, heart is open
I'll be waiting, come find me


[Verse 2]
We've lost our way
That's what you told me last
But tears they come and go
This is us, I'll never get enough
It's taking losing you to know

If you're ready, heart is open
I'll be waiting, come find me
If you're searching for forever
I'll be waiting, come find me
I see you, here in the darkness
Blinding light right where your heart is

1485,My Love (feat. T.I.),"Justin Timberlake,T.I.","1 ContributorTranslationsEnglishJustin Timberlake - My Love ft. T.I. (Tradução em Português) Lyrics[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Não existe outra mulher que poderia tomar o seu lugar, meu—

[Verso 1: Justin Timberlake]
Se eu te escrevesse uma sinfonia
Só para dizer o quanto você significa para mim (O que você faria?)
Se eu dissesse que você é linda
Você sairia comigo regularmente? (Me diga, você sairia?)
Bem, baby, eu estive ao redor do mundo
Mas eu não me vi outra garota (Como você)
Esse anel aqui representa o meu coração
Mas há apenas uma coisa que eu preciso dе você (Diga ""Eu aceito"")
Porque

[Refrão: Justin Timberlake e Timbaland]
Eu consigo ver a gеnte de mãos dadas
Caminhando na praia, nossos pés na areia
Eu posso ver a gente no campo
Sentados na grama, deitados lado a lado
Você pode ser o meu amor
Deixa eu te transformar na minha dama, garota, você me surpreende
Não precisa fazer nenhuma loucura
Veja, tudo que eu quero que você faça é ser o meu amor (Então não ceda)
Meu amor (Então não ceda)
Meu amor (Então não ceda)
Não existe outra mulher que poderia tomar o seu lugar
Meu amor (Então não ceda)
Meu amor (Então não ceda)
Meu amor (Então não ceda)
Não existe outra mulher que poderia tomar o seu lugar, meu amor
Amor, garota, meu amor, meu amor


[Verso 2: Justin Timberlake]
Agora, se eu te escrevesse um bilhete de amor
E te fizesse sorrir a cada palavra que eu escrevesse (O que você faria?)
Isso faria você querer mudar de cena
E que ser a única do meu time? (Me diga, quer?)
Veja, qual é a vantagem em esperar mais?
Porque garota, eu nunca tive mais certeza (Isso, baby, é você)
Esse anel aqui representa o meu coração
E tudo que você estava esperando (Apenas diga, ""Eu aceito"")
Porque

[Refrão: Justin Timberlake e Timbaland]
Eu consigo ver a gente de mãos dadas
Caminhando na praia, nossos pés na areia
Eu posso ver a gente no campo
Sentados na grama, deitados lado a lado
Você pode ser o meu amor
Deixa eu te transformar na minha dama, garota, você me surpreende
Não precisa fazer nenhuma loucura
Veja, tudo que eu quero que você faça é ser o meu amor (Então não ceda)
Meu amor (Então não ceda)
Meu amor (Então não ceda)
Não existe outra mulher que poderia tomar o seu lugar
Meu amor (Então não ceda)
Meu amor (Então não ceda)
Meu amor (Então não ceda)
Não existe outra mulher que poderia tomar o seu lugar, meu amor
Amor, meu amor, meu amor


[Interlúdio: T.I.]
Beleza, é hora de conseguir, JT
Eu não sei por que você tá hesitando, cara
Ay, ay, ay

[Verso 3: T.I.]
A mina é refrescante igual um ventilador, em movimento mais uma vez (Ay)
Mas ele ainda tem fãs do Peru ao Japão
Hey, escuta, baby, eu não quero estragar seu plano (Não)
Mas se você tem um homem, tente perdê-lo se puder
Porque as garotas do mundo todo jogam as mãos pra cima
Quando elas querem vir e curtir com um cara rico
Você realmente não quer deixar essa chance passar
Porque você não foi vista com um homem tão foda
E, gata, com amigos tão fodas, eu posso voar
No privado, porque eu cuido do meu B.I
Eles me chamam de Candle Guy (Por quê?)
Simplesmente porque eu tô pegando fogo (Haha)
Eu odeio ter que cancelar as minhas férias, então você não pode negar
Eu sou paciente, mas não vou implorar (Não)
Se você não vier, eu não vou morrer
Calma aí, o que você quer dizer? Você não pode vir? Por quê? (Por quê?)
Eu e seu namorado, não temos laços (Uh-uh)
Você disse que quer curtir quando eu não tô tão chapado (Cara...)
Bem, baby, é óbvio que eu não o sou seu cara
Eu não vou mentir, vou preencher seu espaço
Mas esquecer o seu rosto, eu juro que vou
St. Bart's, Anguila, em qualquer lugar que eu relaxe (Legal)
Só trago comigo um par, eu vou (Vamo lá)


[Refrão: Justin Timberlake]
Eu consigo ver a gente de mãos dadas
Caminhando na praia, nossos pés na areia
Eu posso ver a gente no campo
Sentados na grama, deitados lado a lado
Você pode ser o meu amor
Deixa eu te transformar na minha dama, garota, você me surpreende
Não precisa fazer nenhuma loucura
Veja, tudo que eu quero que você faça é ser o meu amor (Amor)
Meu amor (Amor)
Meu amor (Amor)
Não existe outra mulher que poderia tomar o seu lugar

Não existe outra mulher que poderia tomar o seu lugar, meu amor

Don't know why, but girl, I'm feelin' close to you
Maybe it's this ocean view, I'm so emotional
And all these thoughts been dancin' on my head
For too long, too long, too long
I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you
But every time I'm close to you
The words wanna come out, but I forget

'Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore


[Chorus]
A crowded room anywhere
A million people around, all I see is you there
Everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears

But my camera lens has only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, becomes so clear, becomes so clear

Now that I know the truth, what am I supposed to do?
Changin' up and breakin' all my rules ever since we met
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone (And I know that)
Just like the movie shoot, I'm zoomin' in on you
Everything is extra and the background just fades into the set
As we ride off into the sun

It might seem like I'm catchin' somethin'
That's because it's true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it

Crying myself to sleep on the sofa (When you're lonely)
I told ya I'm more than the kid with a chauffeur
Who don't know the life of a soldier, I'm older now
The world's a lot colder now
The MSFTS'll stay on the up and up, I'm tryna hold it down
They stay attacking us, I'ma just weep on my willow
I look what they saying, they playing as I go to sleep on my pillow
But then when I open my eyes, I wish to see you (Love)
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time (Time)
Well, I guess you're somewhere with your crew (Crew)

You need to stand for something or else you'll fall for nothing
Girl, this not my country, we all come from Africa
Now we’re onto something, girl, you're hella grumpy
I think you're just hungry, cause right now you're acting up
I don't think you want me, you just want my company
While your man is —ing all these girls who laugh at us
Girl, you got me running from you, I want nothing

But baby, you could be the one I'm telling all my secrets
When I'm all alone
Baby girl, you know I'm rolling
(Baby, you could run away)
Get you without any clothes, I'm focused
(Baby, you could run away)
Our love is drowning in the ocean, hopeless
(Baby, you could run away)
(You could run away)
Rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling
Baby girl, you got me rolling
Damn, out of your control when
I touch your body in the ocean
Then you feel these raw emotions
(Then you feel these raw emotions)
[Interlude: Jaden]
Syre
Passion, Pain and Desire just like my big bro'
What you didn't know it's this young kid's been in limbo
Since that gunshot wound on that hidden road
Lost, broken, invisible
But when that light gets low, he's invincible
So much soul that he redefined inevitable
So it'll never go
So the sun never set at all instead of setting slow
And as the legend goes Syre lived forever on
And never and forever alone, Syre

[Bridge: Jaden, Lido, both]
I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I'm rolling, I'm rolling
Saying that we'll run away
I doubt that we'll ever go
I hope the sunset will stay
We traveled too far from home
Baby, we don’t need a hero
I have never been a hero
Your love always been a zero
Baby, you should be the hero
Baby, you should be the hero

[Outro]
Legend says Syre still exists in the mist, in the fog
Poets say he ascended to the Gods
Skeptics say he pretended to be gone
But I say that he's eternally lost"

From my first day till now

Only when we drove outside this town
And I'm so fed up with being held
Don't try to hold me now

I suppose that I told

Y'all are a buncha posers, with over exposure
JJ Fad hair cuts and padded shoulders
Next year, dudes will probably be wearin' high heels
Make-up like a bitch, do whatever to sign deals
And I ain't just some old head stuck in my old ways
But I ain't feelin' rappers who look like they go both ways
Was raised in the greatest generation to do it
And you can hear it in my music now that rap is polluted
I'm like the Druid, a human, removin' all of the sewage
That y'all are spewin' and stewin' in dirty bodily fluids
I'm like the Brita to get rid of the shit they put in the water
They started to poison the people, the people they alter
Fluoridating, sedating the brain and breakin' they will
The same shit happened to rap, they extracted the skill
It's like pop is a poison, in the form of a pill
And you understand the risk, but you takin' it still
Every body recycles everybody else beats
50 versions of a song, 30 times in a week
That everybody repeats, that everybody is weak
East coast rappers be dick ridin' dirty south beats
There's no sense of culture, it's over, it's a wrap
Like what whites did to jazz when the music was black
Now these Internet fuck boys speak like it's fact
With that overly emotional rap, it's so wack


[Hook: Apathy]
Rap is not pop, If you call it that then stop
You ain't ever lived it, you new to hip-hop
Downloaded, googled it, when an album dropped
Never ever ever been inside a record shop

You ain't ever lived it, you new to hip-hop
Downloaded, googled it, when an album dropped
Never ever ever been inside a record shop

[Verse 2: Apathy]
I put a bullet in my radio, put it out of it's misery
It'll be a cold day in hell before they get to me
Never surrender to their gender bender agenda
Remember Nebuchadnezzar and just return it to sender
I'm bout to burn it forever they Babylonian loadin' in
The subliminal Visuals since you watched nickelodeon
Or the pimp at the podium talkin' slick til you vote for them
I'd rather cut 'em open and soak the fucker in sodium
Stadiums packed with clones who scream and clap
For an auto-tuned hack singin' emo rap
Y'all need to stop what ya doin' like my Preemo track
You're so arrogant, it's embarrassin', your ego's wack
I'm too... Kool G Rap for these new school cats
I'm Freddie Foxxx with burn marks from Glocks on wax
I hi-jack racks relax steady stick to the facts
'Cause stick up kids is out to tax
Volume at the max with the sunroof back
I was rappin' when the rappers didn't care about a plaque
Or the plastic facade, it's fact it's a fraud
Aps classic a rap intergalactic god
Escaped from a pod like Kal-El from out Hell
With flows that would make any earthlings mouth melt
Yo... Watchin' MTV With Public Enemy
Peace to Ted Demme, I was raised on that energy


[Hook: Apathy]
Rap is not pop, If you call it that then stop
You ain't ever lived it, you new to hip-hop

Ну что ж, замечательно

Хотя нет, мне уже легче, но
Что будет, если я так и не встречу тебя
Совсем никогда?

В тесноте изменило вектор
Захотел и утолил жажду
От огромной такой вселенной

Хоть и временно, но
В сотый раз, наверно

[Куплет 1]
Она не придёт
Её разорвали собаки
Арматурой забили скинхеды
Надломился предательский лёд
Её руки подготовлены не были к драке
И она не желала победы
Я теперь буду вместо неё

[Припев]
Она плавает в формалине
Несовершенство линий
Движется постепенно
У меня её лицо, её имя
Свитер такой же синий
Никто не заметил подмены

[Куплет 2]
Она не придет
Руки были в змеиной норе
Голова в осином гнезде
А спина в муравьиной куче
Буду я — я из более прочного теста
Я достойна занять это место
Я многое делаю лучше


[Припев]
Она плавает в формалине
Двигаясь постепенно
В мутном белом тумане
У меня её лицо, её имя
Никто не заметил подмены
Ключи проверяя в кармане

[Куплет 3]
Я наверное что-то не то играю
Я не знаю, кто эти люди
Улыбаюсь немного странно
Заподозрят, что я не она — другая
Я не знаю, что тогда будет
Притворюсь больной или пьяной

[Припев]
Она плавает в формалине
Несовершенство линий
Движется постепенно
У меня её лицо, её имя
Свитер такой же синий
Никто не заметил подмены

И ведь за это цепляют ц-ц-цепь и цепляется
Это хип-хап и у него есть яйца
Мой аль— не помещается суете в глотку
Его не отобрать — это отпечатки пальцев

Никто из нас не помнит, что было вчера
Но почему-то каждое, каждое утро
Мы начинаем новый день с косяка

Would you run and find another life to imitate?

[Verse 1]
Soldiers in the night and we lurkin'
Medieval flowers in my church, we workin'
I'm in the bottomless pit, Silver Surfer surfin'
I lived a thousand lives, but I'm still searchin' (Where they at?)
Broken glass in my hands, sister's twerkin'
Money on the floor and she nervous
Paint a picture like Van Gogh, I'm cursed man
Skrrt skrrt to the moon, bitch, I'm swervin' (Skrrt)
Hit the curve and my shit broke bitch hurtin'
I was down, so deep down but time's turnin' (Darkness on my)
Darkness in my mind, flip the mattress, I got dough (Dough)
Harvest on my line, I live the story I was told (Told)

[Verse 2]
I heard shooters on the roof, yeah, they tryna shoot ya
I'm in a dark room, candles singin' hallelujah
You think I'm gone too much, well, I think I suit you
You say I'm in my mind too much, well, I know that suits you
I lost everything, only thing I'm scared is to lose you
I heard voices in my head, yeah, they whispered to us
Paranoid, sledgehammer, that's my Ruger
Woke up, realized I had to move up (Leandoer)
Worked my soul away everyday, now my loot up
But the truth is, I wish I never knew us
God of violence, pink dreams in my two cup
I've told you this was gonna end, but I fooled you

Cut off my fingers to touch your smile
Feels like I'm walkin' on water, not wine

When we were livin' in squalor, wasn't it Heaven?
Back when we used to get on it four out of seven
Now even though that was a time I hated from day one
Eventually, terrible memories turn into great ones

[Pre-Chorus]
So if they call you, embrace them
If they hold you, erase them

'Cause it might've been somethin', who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might've missed somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might've been somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday

[Verse 2]
Matty said life didn't go the way that he planned it

A rolling of thunder
Wolves scolding each other as
The roses take cover
In the black of the night
Passions extinguish
In short, whispered sentences
Banished from memories
Is the thought of yesterday
Now I look past my shoulder
For the face of my mother
Did I see her smiling
Or was it all a dream?
No, I seem to recall
The perfume of roses
Today they’re all hiding
The dewdrops are frozen

Half fool, half blind, half awake girl
Half fool, half blind, half awake world
Half fool, half blind, half awake girl
Half fool, half blind, half awake world

Come out, blossom roses
The wolf is sending messages
Sweet perfume of love
Just under our noses
I won’t hold my horses
Just leave what's above
Sweet labor of love
Just surrender to the other

Half fool, half blind, half awake girl
Half fool, half blind, half awake world
Half fool, half blind, half awake girl
Half fool, half blind, half awake world

Sweet lover, keep loving [x12]

Come out, sweet hypnosis
I'll never know what overdose is
The sweet vapor of love
Just like a drug, it discloses
Awaken quiet senses
We'll write a new synopsis
The sweet liquor of love
You left a drop, to discover"

I'm writin' a book on how to stay conscious when you drown
And if the words float up to the surface, I'll keep 'em down
This is the first time I know I don't want the crown
You can take it now
You promised the world and brought me it hangin' from a string
Stuck it in my mouth, into my throat, told me to sing
That was the first time I knew you can't kill the king
And those who kiss the ring

Tell me how
It's better when the sun goes down
We will never escape this town
I wasn't scared when he caught me, look what it taught me
Tell me how
It's better if I make no sound
I will never escape these doubts
I wasn't dead when they found me, watch as they pull me down

On what to do after you grew to hate what you used to love
That was the first time I knew they were out for blood

Каковы мои дела?
Все нормально, все окей
Как ты меня довела?
Я не хочу слушать людей

Я растворяюсь в стакане как bestie
Мы не похожи, мы не будем вместе
Остывай, думаю, что ты самая, что решиться на многое
Поведение жесткое
Поведение одинокое

Забывай, это мой шанс, это мой момент
Я двигал это так долго
Что сейчас я навряд ли смогу назвать кого-то кент
Кем я буду когда вырасту?
Все связанно слишком плотно
В одном zip'e 5 грамм

И если бог существует, то пусть принесет
Свободу моим пацанам
Смерть всем моим врагам
Мой самый дикий напалм


Иду по головам
Мешаю Шотландский Chivas и Аннинскую za
Я не работал никогда
И я выигрываю тут без суда
А-а, в комнате так темно
Я вас выигрываю, решено
Мне стать тупым к счастью не дано

The words that we'd say if we walked past them
Our lives and our art and how we would craft them
Complaining for hours and hours and hours of lovers and friends

None of it even mattered

There's nothing sacred
What about all of the questions?
What about Heaven?

What about Heaven?

What about your blessing?
What about your presence?
What about the breath I take?
Will I make it through the day?
What if you're not forgiven?
What if you're not forgiven?

We forgot to talk about heaven
There's nothing sacred
What about all of the questions?
What about Heaven?

Ali, you know our hearts were at their fullest
Ali, there were no words to stop the bullets

[Verse 1]
Concrete dreams, I could never leave
And I go back to when we were thirteen and fifteen and seventeen
The full night to the coldest breeze
All that we hoped to be
When we smiled with all our teeth

[Chorus]
Ali, you know our hearts were at their fullest
Ali, there werе no words to stop the bullets

[Verse 2]
You should've lеft your home
I told you to go
I told you it wouldn't be safe
I told you it wasn't the way
You should've left your home
I told you to go
I told you it wouldn't be safe
Oh how I prayed and I prayed

[Verse 3]
And since the angel was at your door
I can't walk by anymore
You slipped through my arms
I see you on your sister's shirt
And it's hard to mask the hurt
And it's hard to mask your world


[Chorus]
Ali, you know our hearts were at their fullest
Ali, there were no words to stop the bullets

Now it's only me that needs to save himself
Feel like I can't be here while you're in that realm
Oh I need time
Oh I need time
Oh I need time, to mourn you

1536,I Can Barely Breathe,Manchester Orchestra,"13 ContributorsI Can Barely Breathe LyricsWhen the dark flood came
We wrapped ourselves inside a dirty blanket
Citing different opinions
On whether we should move

When the houses came
They ate up everyone like they were fishes
Saying, ""Come on, come on
It's the end of the world""

And then I saw your face
You're turnin' skin into a dirty secret
I watched the beauties, watched the fire
And the fire burn the beauty in their eyes

When I took the blame
We laid in ruins tryin' to quote your phrase
We're yelling, ""Someone's got the answers
But I'd rather think there's nothing to be found""

If you knew I was dying would it change you?
If you knew I was dying would it change?
If you knew I was dying would it change you?
If you knew I was dying would it change anything?
So when you see me falling backwards
Down the wall that says, I'm still alive
Don't be cautious when I'm cautiously
Approachin' on the other side


Ya everybody has their reasons
That's the reason we're all gonna die
Because if seein' is believin'
Then believe that we have lost our eyes

'Cause when I fly solo I fly so high
'Cause when I fly solo I fly so high
'Cause when I fly solo I fly so high
'Cause when I fly solo I fly so high
I fly so high, don't touch me now

We all deserve
We all deserve something"

Dead in the water, it's not a paid vacation
The sons and daughters of city officials attend demonstrations
It's hardly a sink or swim when all is well if the ticket sells

Out with a whimper, it's not a blaze of glory
You look down from your temple as people endeavor to make it a story
And chisel a marble word, but all is lost if it's never heard

[Chorus]
But I've got someone to make reports that tell me how my money's spent
To book my stays and draw my blinds so I can't tell what's really there
And all I need's a great big congratulations

[Verse 3]
I'll keep your dreams, you pay attention for me
As strange as it seems, I'd rather dissolve than have you ignore me
The ground may be moving fast but I tied my boots to a broken mast

[Verse 4]
The difference is clear, you throw it in your cauldron
Rust and veneer, dusk and dawn, Steinways and Baldwins
You start with a simple stock of all the waste and salt to taste

I save my grace with half-assed guilt and lay down the quilt upon the lawn

Но я вытираю тушь с глаз твоих, с губ твоих...
Эти дома казались нам с тобой тогда пустыми
Казалось, не остынем, казалось, все осилим

Не трожь, воспоминания сильнее ранят так
Оставят там, суета, ведь ты не та
Контуры лица, красные от слез глаза
Не забыть мне никогда, ночи полные без сна
Оставь все то, что было в памяти
Дай уйти, не сошлись пути, просто отпусти
Не держи в себе обиду, не кури ночами
Вспоминая, как мы с тобой летали

Эти дома казались нам с тобой пустыми

Не отпускай, дура, держи как можно крепче
Не топи грусть алкоголем — так не будет легче
И тонны слез твоих, для меня не значат ничего
Отдал бы все, чтоб не видеть тебя вновь
Любовь — теперь синоним к слову лёд
Выкинь прочь, даже левые суки мне не смогут помочь
Я искал среди них твои глаза, поверь мне на слово
Больше не хочу повторять все это заново

Эти дома казались нам с тобой тогда пустыми

Me and the horse, we ran out of the place (Out the place)
Then we drove my Porsche back to my place

Reputations made, I failed to save
The cold I seek is all I'll feel
Today I'm selling mine after all
Watch it all fade away to gray
I sold it to rule the world

If only I could rescue you
Cleaning up the mess we've made, it's not the same without your love (without your love)
Without your love

[Chorus]
Do you care at all?
I don't see a difference
Is this love at all?

[Verse 2]
We stayed so close in this life at one time
Now I watch as you fade away
Behind the wall of hate inside your mind
Will we meet again?
I'll be waiting beyond the edge
Forever frozen
Now time stops again

Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
I can tell that we are gonna be friends

[Verse 2]
Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we found
Safely walk to school without a sound
Safely walk to school without a sound

[Verse 3]
Here we are, no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn

[Verse 4]
Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns and books, and show and tell
Playtime, we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
Teacher marks our height against the wall


[Bridge]
And we don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing

[Verse 5]
Tonight I'll dream, while I’m in bed
When silly thoughts go through my head
About the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow, I'll bet
That you and I will walk together again

I can tell that we are gonna be friends
Yes, I can tell that we are gonna be friends"

Nothin' that I write can make me feel good

Neon lights surroundin' me, I indulge in luxury
Everything I do is wrong, 'cept for when I hit the bong
Hit the bong, hit the bo—, feel good
Feelin' shitty in my bed, didn't take my fuckin' meds
Hyperpop up in my ears, everything just disappears
Don't wanna be someone else, just don't wanna hate myself
I just don't wanna hate myself, instead I wanna feel good

Nothing to you
So maybe I'm still a love fool

She carries sweetly infectious magic formulas

It's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see
I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse
See, its a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother, can choose a color
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these
Futures that we have to be told
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad. (happiness)
Oh yeah
I know yeah
Oh this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change, yeah
Things will never be the same
And I can't go on
Well we're living, oh oh
Virtual insanity
Oh this world has got to change
'Cause I just, I just can't keep going on
In this virtual, virtual insanity
That we're living in, that we're living in
That virtual insanity is what is
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground, oh
Futures made of that virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by our love
For useless, twisting, of that new technology

And I begin to wonder why

Couple hours can change your life

Maybe I should go outside so I could get a fucking life
I made a friend and she spent the night, and now

Back when we spoke in Europe
I need insurance on my emotions
I can't get hurt again
(Fuck the past, fuck them, they all made me sad)
And I had no time to prepare to face my fears
I guess that it's time that I dried these tears

[Outro]
But if I could just be happy by the end of this song
But if by the time you hear it, you are already gone
And it didn't go to plan
Then why should I continue in this life
When there's no one around to be the one who makes me smile?

We're breaking promises we thought we could keep
We trigger avalanches unknowingly
We travel in and out, we take off, we land
We live in airports like we don't have a plan
This is a journey and we call it home
And when it stops we're feeling miserable, well

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We're breaking promises we thought we could keep
We trigger hurricanes unwillingly
It's our fault when it all
Breaks into everyone's lives
But are we really to blame?

Despair, hangover and ecstasy
So many people around
We disappoint and let down
And though we're trying our best
Despair, hangover and ecstasy
Despair, hangover and ecstasy

We're breaking promises we thought we could keep
We trigger avalanches unknowingly, oh
We're not so different from convicts on the run
Freedom could kill us but we'd rather go on
This is a journey and we wanna go far
They say we're selfish but this plane is on fire


[Pre-Chorus 2]
We're breaking promises we wanted to keep
We trigger hurricanes unwillingly
It's our fault when it all
Gets into everyone's lives
Still we would do it again

[Chorus]
It's like a pain in the chest
Despair, hangover and ecstasy
So many people around
We disappoint and let down
And though we're trying our best
Despair, hangover and ecstasy
Despair, hangover and ecstasy

[Chorus]
Like a pain in the chest
Despair, hangover and ecstasy
So many people around
We disappoint and let down
And though we're trying our best
Despair, hangover and ecstasy
Our only mission, our destiny"

Race through the valley of the stars
Run like a river through the heart
Why can't I feel it when I fall?
Scream drive faster
Push my body against the wall
Hot like a fever in the fall
Bloom like a flower in the spring
Scream drive faster

Moving fast to nowhere, nowhere
Clouds pass, days last forever
The sun fades, drive into the ocean
I'm right out here in a blue, blue sea

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy, ready to love
Right, I say
Easy, ready to love

[Chorus]
I don't wanna feel it, always running away
I don't really need it, go on, take it away
Take it all, take it all
I don't wanna feel it, always running away
I don't really need it, go on, take it away
Take it all, take it all


[Verse 2]
Run like a killer in the wind
Rage like a rebel wunderkind
Touching the city after dark
Scream drive faster
Smoke like a summer in the sun
Sweet like the thunder on my tongue
Sweat out a fever in the night
Scream drive faster

[Refrain]
Moving fast to nowhere, nowhere
Clouds pass, days last forever
The sun fades, drive into the ocean
I'm right out here in a blue, blue sea

This that Calabasas Freestyle, let's go

[Verse]
This that fresh whip
Pull the checks, receipt stashed, straight to the palm, drippin’
I been gone too long, feel like it's all different (Oh)
Swear, I've been nowhere specific
In between destinations and flyin’ over the Pacific
And all these jets that we rented
I seen niggas fumble with frames, tryna keep up they image
I write writtens to break the bars of your mental prison
Stencil hieroglyphs with colored pencils to Central Britain
This is potential business, the monster has awoken
And they stressed 'cause he's dressing different
And gassin' the freshest niggas, you're fuckin' fantastic
And your fashion is Activision (Whoo)
No wonder they act suspicious, they mad defensive
Man, they couldn't even grasp most practical sense
Fuck it, I'm blasted, I’m reckless (Oh shit)
With no actual past, it’s impressive
Rap is just one of my fetishes, like a dragon that's pregnant
Young boys lyin’ on they records (Whoo)
Baby if I say I got the cash, it's a factual sentence
This is drastically different (Woah)
That's why I had to drop the tape just to gradually shift it
Why this lil' nigga wearin’ rags if he got all the riches?
Shadow boxin' demons, diggin' ditches for all of these lizards
When I'm finished with 'em
And they can't understand my intentions (No)
Man, they can't understand my inventions (Yeah)
Wish I had a intervention when I was stuck in detention (Whoo)
Ten black sheep deep, they just want us to blend in (Oh)
That's what the neural net will say when the AI is sentient
I'm a art connoisseur, hope you all remember this
And tell the future Kama Sutra, got the latest, let 'em in
I'm just a youngin' but I got the knowledge like a veteran


[Bridge]
Oh my, 'nother young black boy dead again
Fuck this, 'bout to blow the top off, let it rip
No shade, new figures, new clip
These niggas won't stick, try to put us in the chains
I just bought a new wrist, I just bought a new whip
Put the vision on the top, say we too hubris
Tried to kick us out the block, I been on my new shit
Man we come if you ready or not
Man I'm with the squad, they got all the guap
We don't ever see you at the spot, they just talk a lot

[Outro]
Ooh, woah (Ooh, yuh)
They just like to talk a lot
Ooh, woah (Yuh, damn)
Yah (Tell 'em we on the way)
Nah, we need a big table in the party
The big table, the one in the middle (Yah)
You already know what it is
Tell Jordan I'm back in his city, no games
Somebody get Azi on the phone with a loud pack
Nah, nah, nah, I need the, I need the spaghetti from Toscanova
With the olive oil and the garlic
With the motherfuckin' truffle fries with no cheese, nigga
We rabid, what you thought it was? (Yah, ayy, yah)
Ayy, yah
Yah, ayy, yah
Chances are I'm just drunk, get him another GoPro, let's go

I wanna turn those blue lights into strobe lights
Not blue flashing lights, maybe fairy lights
Those blue lights (Blue lights), into strobe lights (Strobe lights)
Maybe even fairy lights (Fairy lights), not blue flashing lights

[Verse 1]
Don't you run when you hear the sirens comin'
When you hear the sirens comin'
You better not run 'cause the sirens not comin' for you
What have you done?
You went to school that day
Was a bit late but it was a Monday
Kept after class for answering back
You apologized, any harm in that?

[Chorus]
(I wanna turn those blue lights) What have you done?
(Into strobe lights) There's no need to run
(Not blue flashing lights) If you've done nothing wrong
(Maybe fairy lights) Blue lights should just pass you by
[Verse 2]
Gun crime into your right ear
Drugs and violence into your left
Default white headphones flooding the auditory
Subconscious waves you accept
You're sitting on the 4 back home
""Where you at, G? Answer your phone""
Paused the poison to answer his message
Your boy sounds rushed, fears for his adolescence


[Chorus]
(I wanna turn those blue lights) What have you done?
(Into strobe lights) There's no need to run
(Not blue flashing lights) If you've done nothing wrong
(Maybe fairy lights) Blue lights should just pass you by

[Verse 3]
Tall black shadow as you're getting off the bus
Shadow shows no emotion, so what's even the fuss?
But the face on your boy casts a darker picture
Of the red handed act, he's gonna whisper
""Look, blud, I'm sorry, 'cause I know you got my back
He was runnin', I couldn't think, I had to get out of that""
Not long ago you were miming to the ""Shook Ones""
Now this really is part two 'cause you're the shook one
Hands you the tool as you question your friendship
How's man like you gonna make me a convict?
Level of a felon when I've done nothing wrong
Blood on my hands but I don't know where it's from, oh
You got blood on your hands but you don't know where it's from

[Bridge]
Mm, you better run when you hear the sirens comin'
When you hear the sirens comin'
Better run when you hear the sirens comin'
'Cause they will be coming for you (Ah, ah)
Run when you hear the sirens comin' (Ah, ah)
Better run when you hear the sirens comin' (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
When you hear the sirens comin'
The blue lights are comin' for you


[Chorus]
(I wanna turn those blue lights) What have you done?
(Into strobe lights) There's no need to run
(Not blue flashing lights) If you've done nothing wrong
(Maybe fairy lights) Blue lights should just pass you by

[Outro: Jorja Smith & Dizzee Rascal]
Blud, when you hear the sirens coming
Don't you run when you hear the sirens comin'
Blud, when you hear the sirens coming
Don't you run when you hear the sirens comin'
What have you d-d-d-done, done?
Don't you run

Холодно...
Якби не було і як би не дуло в твоє вікно
З ким би не йшла до сну
В тобі я втоплю свою весну

Хто б не лишився з тобою сховатися від дощу
Або лишив одну
В тобі я знайду свою весну

Як би не було і як не боліла б твоя любов
З ким не вела б війну

Як би не було тобі десь опівночі сам-на-сам
Знай, все одно знайду
І тебе - вип’ю свою весну

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)

Look, mama hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now

Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it, yeah

Close it and hope it decays
Oh, inhale and I'm up and away

I love those mornings when the sun's up
Smoking in the lobby, waiting for my name to pop up

Sky-high deflating ideas
Thriving off your lessons, yes, you are my lantern
A shy light curves around my ears
The more you speak, the more I see
The more your light grows upon me
And the more it grows
The closer I think you are, the closer I think you are
To seeing me whole
What if you don't like what you see? Silhouettes inside a dream
And I'm melting from the light
One drip at a time (Two, four, two, zero)
I'm melting from the light
One drip, one drip at a time

Mbabarara, mbabarara
Mbabarara, mbabarara, mbabarara

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But Momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun (Mbabarara, mbabarara)


[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
It's been a while since we talked last
And I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But Dad, I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that'll make you way proud of your son
And I know you heard the last song
About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (Mbabarara)
I love it when she calls my phone
She's even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (Mbabarara)
It's gonna be a long drive home
But I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door, take off my coat, and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure like


[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
She's got a smile that'll make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue (I'm not done)
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there (Man, I swear)
She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten
Now she's even got her own song (But movin' on)
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours (Not sayin' one word)
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future, she's the main component
Call it dumb, call it luck, call it love
Or whatever you call it, but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like
[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)"

Mi sento pericoloso, Mi viene la nausea
La strada mi ha lasciato pazzo, [?], voglio
Fumare e essere fatto, [?]
Bevo e [?], mi sento pericoloso

[Verso: ScHoolboy Q]
Prendimi per mano fino a quando non mi insegni ad essere fatto
La testa è tra le nuvole con il mio stomaco sotto
Qualcosa riguardo a questo stato d’animo, l'ho sentito prima
Ho preso questa pillola e mi ha sballato del tutto
Pizzicami sul braccio, è il Paradiso o il divertimento?
Se non torno, ho avuto una corsa infernale
L’assaggio attraverso il mio naso, annuso la morte sulla lingua
Non mi sono drogato abbastanza per uscire dalla depressione
Quanti amici intorno a me mi hanno aiutato a perdermi?
Quante scuse userò finché non sarò scusato?
Offusco la mia mattina, non lo sto sognando nel modo giusto
Non c'è modo in cui un fiore possa sbocciare durante notte
La famiglia ha cercato di avvertirmi, ma non è riuscita a tenermi lontano
Finché non trovo il modo di volare, meglio scappare
Ma volare non è volare perché sei bloccato su te stesso
Il mio autista si è preso bene e mi ha fatto schiantare, uh
Ci è voluta una vita, eravamo impantanati
La gallina ha attraversato la strada per uscire dal ghetto
Stavo attraendo questa sensazione più oscura, mi toccavo la faccia
Qualcuno denunci il mio spacciatore (Causa)
Bassi sulla Perc’ e attivo il sub (Sub)
Ho venduto anima e corpo, è una droga da paura (Droga)
Prenditi questa qui, ti mostrerò l’amore, uh
Prenditi questa qui, ti mostrerò l’amore

1641,Взрослые травмы,Valentin Strykalo,"12 ContributorsВзрослые травмы (Adult Traumas) Lyrics[Текст песни «Взрослые травмы»]

[Куплет 1]
Я разбиваю твою посуду
И режу твои новые вещи
Ты знаешь, мне становится легче
Ты спросишь меня: «Что происходит?»
Я подниму свой взгляд оголтелый:
«Не твоё сраное дело»

[Предприпев]
И я не знаю, какие там у тебя детские травмы
Я подарю тебе…

[Припев]
Взрослые травмы
Я обещал, что всё будет нормально, но это неправда
Нормально не будет, а будет ужасно, и вот что забавно:
Я тебя брошу когда-нибудь позже, но взрослые травмы
Но взрослые травмы с тобой навсегда

[Куплет 2]
Я наглотался средства от боли
И сразу вызвал скорую помощь
И больше ты меня не игноришь
Ты думаешь, что я сумасшедший
Но эти опасения ложны
Просто я сложный


[Предприпев]
И я не знаю, какие там у тебя детские травмы
Я подарю тебе…

[Припев]
Взрослые травмы
Я обещал, что всё будет нормально, но это неправда
Нормально не будет, а будет ужасно, и вот что забавно:
Я тебя брошу когда-нибудь позже, но взрослые травмы
Но взрослые травмы с тобой навсегда"

Got a big plan, this mindset, maybe it's right
At the right place and right time, maybe tonight
In a whisper or handshake, sending a sign
Wanna make out and kiss hard? Wait, never mind
Late night in passing mentioned it flipped
To her best friend, it's nothing, maybe it slipped
But the slip turns to terror, and a crush to like
Then she walked in, he froze up, believe it's the fright

[Verse 2]
It's cute in a way 'til you cannot speak
And you leave to have a cigarette and knees get weak
Escape was just a nod and a casual wave
Obsess about it heavy for the next two days
It's only just a crush, it'll go away
It's just like all the others, it'll go away
Or maybe this is danger, and he just don't know
You pray it all away, but it continues to grow

[Chorus]
I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close, soft breast, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear, ""I wanna fucking tear you apart""


[Verse 3]
Then he walked up and told her, thinking maybe it'd pass
And they talked and looked away a lot, doing the dance
Her hand brushed up against his, she left it there
Told him how she felt and then they locked in a stare
They took a step back, thought about it, what should they do?
'Cause there's always repercussions when you're dating in school
But their lips met, and reservations started to pass
Whether this was just an evening or a thing that would last

[Verse 4]
Either way, he wanted her, and this was bad
Wanted to do things to her, it was making him crazy
Now a little crush turned into a like
And now he wants to grab her by the hair and tell her

[Chorus]
I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close, soft breast, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear, ""I wanna fucking tear you apart""

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close, soft breast, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear, ""I wanna fucking tear you apart""
I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close, soft breast, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear, ""I wanna fucking tear you apart"""

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Day that I met you, girl
I knew that it was somethin' special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck, I can't sing, whatever, look)
We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)
And this is where the story and confusion began
'Cause I was at nirvana, but I had to pretend that I wasn't
[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
There go the policeman, knockin' at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, ""I don't know""? (I don't know)
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothin' more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, because

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Tyler, The Creator]
'Cause, girl, you're perfect, but you're too fuckin' young (For me, uh)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up (No)
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fuckin' young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
A six-year difference, uh
Is a ten year sentence
And with the pigment on my skin
I don't want to be another statistic
You bring me joy, joy, joy, joy
And you fill a void that was once missing
And I can say I'm in love


[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
There go the policeman, knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, ""I don't know""? (I don't know)
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid

'Cause, girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up (Woo!)
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fuckin' young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God, yo)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & Toro Y Moi]
When you're thirty-five, I'll be forty-one (But you're too young)
And when I'm twenty-seven, you'll be twenty-one, yo, this is dumb
And when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run (But I know that you're young)
'Cause I'm fucking terrified, yo, this is dumb, you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself (I know that you're too young)
And mentally, you're older than me, and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help (But I know that you're young)
So when you mention ""hang"", I'm thinking 'bout a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation (I know that you're too young)
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention- (But I know that you're young)
Span, it's gonna suck if shit hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off (I know that you're too young)
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught (But I know that you're young)
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds, um
But I found my wings, fuck (I know)


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Charlie Wilson]
But you're too fucking young
I really like you
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
I don't know what to do
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
Funny thing about this is, by the time you hear this
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)
It won't even matter, I'll be in the clear, haha
It's T and Uncle Charlie!
But you're too young
But you're too young

Than just friends, but you're scared

Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)

[Verse: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I'll exit and wait a while
Just say the word, girl
Can't you see the answers are all there?
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wanna rock, I wanna rock with you, girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be

Morning! Today's forecast calls for blue skies

There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin'
Everybody's in a play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day
Hey-ey-hey

See how the sun shines brightly
In the city
On the streets where once was pity

Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feeling lit, feeling like, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling in the Midwest side now
Living my life, getting my dreams

People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out ""Fuck that""
I'mma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

[Chorus]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Yeah, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you know about dreaming, dreaming?
You don't really know about nothing, nothing
Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky?

Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lie awake in the bed full of sorrow


[Chorus]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Yeah, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Yeah, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
Once I get it
I'm gonna get it
I'll be good"

Change my taste in music (I'm fallen)
Make me rise with you (She likes you)

Look, your love's like a river, bae, I've seen better days, yeah
In my soul, you penetrate, I need your energy
Your vibrations make me levitate, sipping Hennessy
Reading bell hooks, she just sayin'

[Chorus]
I'm surprised you do (Baby)
I won't lie to you (I love you)
I'm your guy who's new
Hide me from the blue
I'm dying on the moon, and I just needed you

[Verse 2]
Baby, you are so unusual like cutting cuticles
But that is just what makes you beautiful like watching tulips grow
When you walk, it's just slow motion baby, why you moving slow?
And when you talk, I got my lasers on you like a UFO
Girl your eyes are like the open sea, the simple poetry
This whole generation, OMG, I see your soul, it's older
We should build a city overseas, this country kinda cold
I mean they feed the children dopamine
And leave them on the sofa
I mean, ah, I need someone to renounce with, whoa
Ice bucket challenge in the fountain, whoa
Chance of finding you, one in a 100 thousand, whoa
I just wanna kiss you on the mountain, whoa


[Chorus]
Spend some time with you
I might bend the rules
'Cause I'm in love with you
You can't see the truth
I will show you soon
Just meet me on the moon

[Verse 3]
She said, ""Love is a strong word"", said love is a strong word?
Well I'ma sing it for you baby, I'll be your songbird
If we don't have no loving, how we supposed to move onward?
Her brother just got shot because he stepped on the wrong curb
If love is a strong word, then love is a strong word
Then we'll need lots of loving if we wanna move onward
And I'ma sing it to you, baby, I'll be your songbird
But I'ma keep it honest with you

[Chorus]
I won't lie to you
My pride dies with you
Girl, I love you too
You want me, you got me
You want me, you got me
I will see you soon
You want me, you got me
You want me, you got me
Your homework is due


[Outro]
SYRE, do you remember?
What's the difference from the future and the past?
Just seen Batman, Lex Luthor
Drag racing in the Jag-uar
Started floating through the valley
Of the city of the angel scraping cash
Now I'm bleeding on the people
I forget that I still got an open gash
I'm the realest kid you never had, baby
I won't lie to you
My pride dies with you"

Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered (Yeah)
[Verse: Drake]
Stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need forty-thousand people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was a angry yute while I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud, but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up, we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7 a.m. in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song, it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshiping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me, I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back 2018 to give you the summary

Mas eu não quero que você espere por mim (Ela me segura)
Eu não quero que você espere por muito tempo (Ela me segura)

[Verso 1: Brent Faiyaz]
Ela me segurou como a gravidadе, estamos na primeira página dessеs blogs
Você ficaria brava comigo se o mundo inteiro soubesse em que merda estávamos?
Seria uma tragédia, meus manos estariam viajando pelo mundo como companhias de viagens
Você sempre está nos meus sonhos de viagem
Amarro o Três Listras e vou embora, mas você só me quer em casa
A mina me mandou mensagem tipo, ""Que porra você está fazendo?""
Vadia, eu estou sozinho (Ela me segura)
Você vai me pressionar agora?
Você vai me estressar e me xingar?
Eu já fiquei com muitas mulheres, os sentimentos não me pegam agora (Desanimado)

Não é que eu tenha superado você, não superei, garota (Qual é)
Mas eu tenho coisas pra fazer
É demais ser seu namorado, demais
E você não está tornando isso muito mais fácil
Se eu pelo menos soubesse disso
Quando eu costumava ser seu melhor amigo
Você me vê explodindo

Yeah, viu, eu sou uma estrela, olhe pra mim de longe
É difícil estar na Terra, quando você foi criado em Marte
Você cometa em como eu me movo, muito espaço pra assumir (Continue dizendo merda)
Mas eu vou te dizer a verdade, merda
Agora quando eu for embora, eu vou vagar ao redor do globo por três meses
Isso é muito tempo sem algo que seja doce
Então eu ligo, pequenas guloseimas, isso é um lanche, não um banquete
Eles não significa muito pra mim
Porque eu sei que tenho uma padaria em casa

(Can you feel my heart?)

Can you help the hopeless? Well, I'm begging on my knees
Can you save my bastard soul, will you wait for me?
I'm sorry, brothers, so sorry, lover
Forgive me, father, I love you, mother

[Chorus]
Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel my heart?

[Bridge]
I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim
I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim
I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim

[Pre-Chorus]

Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?"

[Intro: Paul Williams]
Tacto
Yo recuerdo el tacto
Tacto
Yo recuerdo el tacto
¿Dónde pertenezco?
Tacto, necesito algo más
Yo recuerdo el tacto
Necesito algo más en mi mente

[Verso 1: Paul Williams]
Tacto, recuerdo el tacto
Las fotos vinieron con el tacto
Un pintor en mi mente
Dime que ves
Un turista en un sueño
Parece un visitante
Una canción medio olvidada
¿Dónde pertenezco?
Dime que ves
Necesito algo más

[Verso 2: Paul Williams]
Beso, de repente vivo
Llega la felicidad
Hambre como una tormenta
¿Cómo empiezo?
Una habitación dentro de una habitación
Una puerta detrás de una puerta
Tacto, ¿a dónde conduces?
Necesito algo más
Dime que ves
Necesito algo más

You're up, but you'll get down
You're never running from this town
And I think you said
""You'll never get anything better than this
'Cause you're going 'round in circles
And everyone knows you're trouble""

'Cause you read it in a big book
And now you're giving me the look, look
But just remember how we shook, shook
And all the things we took, took
This town's the oldest friend of mine

We get up and we get down
We're always running 'round this town
And to think they said
We'd never make anything better than this
'Cause we're always in small circles
And everyone thinks we're trouble

We didn't read it in a big book

And now we're giving you the look, look

Enclosed in our soul, in truth

Don't give a fuck of what you say

[Verso 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Meus níveis de sede são infinitos e além
Bebendo essa limonada, eu preciso de uma Beyoncé
Não consigo ver direito, esses óculos são Céline Dion
Babacas não conseguem “subir” em mim, salve pro Elon…
Musk, sim, eu tenho um show lotado
A multidão enlouquecida, mas não importa, porque você não está na primeira fila
Eu tenho procurado por uma companheira, escute o alto-falante
Se você bate com a descrição, dá um salve no meu celular
É esse 911


[Ponte: Steve Lacy, Anna of the North & Tyler, The Creator]

Acordei nos subúrbios, subúrbios, com os pássaros, pássaros
Onde você costumava vir e me levar pra um rolê, rolê
Nesses dias você precisa achar um tempo
Até a noite
No trabalho
Disque 9

[Verso 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Cinco carros na garagem
Tanque cheio de combustível
Mas isso não significa nada, nada
Nada, nada, sem você no passageiro
Eu sou o homem mais solitário do mundo
Mas eu sigo “dançando” para disfarçar
Eu tô ficando sem movimentos, porque eu não consigo curtir o blues
Se você sabe algum DJ, fala pra ele me ligar no 911…


Parte II: Mr. Lonely
[Intro: A$AP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q & Tyler, The Creator]
Eu não posso mentir, tenho sido solitário pra caralho
Nego solitário há tempos
Eu não posso mentir, tenho sido solitário pra caralho
Sério, precisa ir pra algum lugar, tipo, comer umas vadias ou outra coisa
Eu não posso mentir, tenho sido solitário pra caralho
Nego estranho há tempos
Eu não posso mentir, tenho sido
Solitário, solitário, solitário, solitário
[Verso: Tyler, The Creator]
Eles dizem que o mais barulhento da sala é o mais fraco
É o que eles acham, mas eu discordo
Eu digo que o falador da sala
É provavelmente o mais solitário da sala (esse sou eu)
Querendo atenção, falador público
Ó meu deus, aquele garoto é solitário pra caralho
Escrevo músicas sobre essas pessoas
Que nem existem, ele é um falso de merda
Uma coisa eu sei, é o que eu quero
Ganhar demais, mas eu não sou o Chicago
Coração lento, lento de verdade, está tão lento
Você não pode me levantar, sou tipo um Gallardo
No começo isso é realmente muito escuro
Tem sido tão escuro, eu acho que você pode me chamar de queimado, huh
Eu tô jogando tipo Hasbro
Eu tô realmente Saari, me chama de Arto
Bati a McLaren, comprei um Tesla pra mim
Eu sei que você está cansado de eu falar que comprei carros ( skrrt)
Mas que merda mais você quer de mim?
Essa é a única coisa que me faz companhia
Compro coisa até ficar enjoado
Essas coisa estão preenchendo o vazio
Tenho feito isso há tanto tempo
Eu nem sei mais se eu gosto dessa merda (ohh)
Atual batalha como um adulto
Meu parceiro é a sombra
Eu preciso de amor, você tem um pouco, eu posso pedir emprestado?
Foda-se, eu poderia achar algum amanhã
Mas isso nunca acontece
Tipo uma vasectomia, o que foi que eu fiz?
Eu tenho o talento, a fama e a grana
Me encontrei a muito tempo, mas ainda não encontrei ninguém (quem)
Espelho, espelho meu (quem)
É o homem mais solitário do mundo (eu)
Cupido agindo como estúpido
Você teria outro número que eu poderia ligar?
Nunca tive um bichinho
Eu nunca tive um bichicho
Tem muitos peixes no mar
Mas eu nunca tive um peixinho dourado pra começar
Eu nunca tive um cachorro
Então eu nunca fui bom com as “cachorras”
Porque eu nunca joguei uma bola, pega
Eu nunca tive um bichinho, é aí que isso começa, eu acho
Me trate como um depósito direto
Dê uma checada alguma hora
Me pergunte como eu vou
Então eu não terei de discar aquele 911

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
(Two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me

Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now

Ayo (My love is gone)
It's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door (My love is gone)
Knock, knock, knock, knock (Who is it?)
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Need me to do it over? Everything)

It really does, it crushes your soul

1690,Thunder,99 Neighbors,"5 ContributorsThunder Lyrics[Chorus: Aidan Ostby]
Little bloody stains in my eyes
Vessel breaking all of the time
Devil’s on the clock 9 to 5
Falling through the stairs while I climb
And I could tell that something wasn’t right
All that empty space on the horizon
If you can’t see a throne why even try?
Never did no drugs, maybe I should try some
In the name of what do I fight?
In the name of what do I fight?

[Verse 1: Swank]
I don’t need to change
Don’t think about it
See some shit so now I drink about it
(Fuck) Can’t sleep
4 AM, I see a figure
Think my life is over but he can’t deliver (Shit)
Sat through all my fuckin’ whispers
Telling me my life been caught up in a twister
I was flying in a circle
I was missing curfew when I had a curfew
If you think I curved you then I probably curved you
I ain’t really sorry baby girl I hurt you
I ain’t gonna rest ’til I fuckin’ drop dead
I been runnin’ outta options
Call me Vinny Checkers, never chill
I pop another pill to get up out my thoughts (Damn)
Life been really toxic, overrated
I don’t feel appreciated anymore
By people I thought it mattered, I don’t get it
I hated the shit I was singin’ before
In a loop, an inner circle
To follow up how to go out and go open these doors
Gotta get it, gotta go and relax
I never thought that I’d make it this far (Ayy)


[Bridge: HANKNATIVE]
All the shit that’s all up on my mind it got me dropping off the map
I put my phone on autopilot for the night so they can’t ask me where I’m, at
Ridin’ through my city in the night solo dolo with the cash
And I just needed space, I’m on the side
Gimme time and I’ll be, back

[Verse 2: HANKNATIVE]
Phone’s low, I let it burn like Usher
I’m a stones throw away from disappointments
I don’t wanna talk, ‘cause I don’t wanna tell ‘em
I don’t wanna fix it, I just want it better
I’ve been broke forever, needing changes
Mental health and wealth in different places
I know life is phases, I know people leave you
Fuck if theirs is greener, then nigga mine is green too
Phone jumpin’, I won’t operate it
I won’ let ‘em play me unless it’s on a playlist
Leave it off for the rainy days
‘cause I don’t wanna feel and I don’t wanna shade ‘em
Known numbers tryna check my wavelength
'Cause they noticed Hank ain’t been up on the same shit
I need time and separation from it
Bein’ honest all I really want is space, shit

[Chorus: Aidan Ostby]
Little bloody stains in my eyes
Vessel breaking all of the time
Devil’s on the clock 9 to 5
Falling through the stairs while I climb
And I could tell that something wasn’t right
All that empty space on the horizon
If you can’t see a throne why even try?
Never did no drugs, maybe I should try some
In the name of what do I fight?
In the name of what do I fight?


[Verse 3: Sam Paulino]
Hard not to have ego
When I’m in a room full of mirrors, I’m a whole different person
But I feel like nothing’s workin’
I got friends and family that rely on me
And my shorty told me she would die for me
I got niggas that say they would ride for me
’Til I’m down on my luck and they hide from me
I got trust issues
Feel like I’m on top of the world, but somehow I’ll lose it all
Due to liquor, strippers snorting Adderall
As soon as I finish this album off, it’ll all evolve
Sick of chasin’
Highs and lows in all these different places
Devils workin’ I can feel it, I know he’s obsessed with me
Please don’t catch up to me runnin’ from

[Outro: Sam Paulino]
Fear in my mind
Never see it clear through my eyes
Faded on this long midnight drive
Stuck inside a life that ain’t mine
You can see that something isn’t right
All that empty space under both eyelids
I don’t answer calls, I don’t even try
Lookin’ for the plug, maybe I can find some
In the name of what do I fight?
In the name of what do I fight?"

Ну, да, наверное, мой скутер не Benz
Но всё равно я подкатил бы к тебе
И раз уж вышло, что я уже здесь
Привет

Твоих глаз напротив блеск, под ногами мир исчез
Нам бы вместе на Луну, но мне хочется прям здесь
На вопрос мой «Как дела?» ты снова не ответишь честно
Но мне правда интересно, это не тупой обвес
На руке тату крест, у меня тоже есть
Никогда их не считал, но, наверное, штук шесть
Есть с собой шлем второй, нет на шее VVS
Но может стать простая Vespa той каретой для принцесс

Есть что дунуть, есть что выпить, есть кому сейчас набрать
Жизнь прекрасна, и в неё осталось добавить тебя

Классно можно пообщаться, классно можно помолчать
Забывая про девайсы и покинув общий чат
Если рядом человек продолжением тебя
Которому не побоялся подойти я и сказать:

Hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me, oh, so tight
Show me that you love me, too

Won't you kiss me once, baby
Just a kiss goodnight, maybe
You and I will fall in love

A game you just can't win
If there's a way, I'll find it someday
And then this fool will rush in

Tá louca demais agora

[Verso 1: Beyoncé]
Eu olho profundamente nos seus olhos (Eu...)
Eu toco em você mais e mais toda vez
Quando você sai, eu fico implorando pra você não ir
Chamo seu nome, duas, três vezes seguidas
É uma coisa tão engraçada pra eu tentar explicar
Como estou me sentindo, e o meu orgulho é o culpado (Yeah)
Porque eu sei que não entendo
Como o seu amor pode fazer o que ninguém mais pode


[Refrão 2: Beyoncé]
Me dеixou tão louca agora
Seu amor me deixou tão louca agora (Sеu amor)
Me deixou tão louca agora

Quando eu falo com as minhas amigas no quieto
(""Quem ele pensa que é?"") Olha o que você fez comigo
De tênis, nem preciso comprar um vestido novo
Se você não estiver aí, não tenho mais ninguém pra impressionar
É o jeito que você sabe o que eu pensei que sabia
É a batida que meu coração faz quando estou com você
Mas eu ainda não entendo
Como o seu amor pode fazer o que ninguém mais pode

Eu balaço esses falsos, cara, você não pode chegar perto
O artigo genuíno, eu não canto
Eu atiro, se acontecer algo, eu te mato
Uma estrela igual o Ringo, guerra igual uma Boina Verde
Você é louco? Traga a sua tropa toda
O JAY-Z tá na Range, louco e perturbado
Eles não conseguem entendê-lo, eles estão tipo, ""Hey, ele é louco?"" (Oh, não)
Sim senhor, eu fui feito de um tecido diferente
Minha textura é o melhor casaco de pele: chinchila
Tenho estado mais foda do que os fumantes compulsivos
Como você acha que ganhei o nome Hova?
Tenho sido o mais real, o jogo acabou
Volte isso, Young
Desde que eu fiz a mudança pra platina
O jogo já tem um dono, faloupç


[Ponte: Beyoncé]
Me deixou, tão louca, meu amor
Eu não sou eu mesma ultimamente, sou tola, eu não faço isso
Eu estive brincando comigo mesma, baby, eu não me importo
Porque o seu amor tira o melhor de mim
E baby, você está me deixando boba
Você me pegou de jeito e eu não me importo com quem vê
Porque baby, você me pegou, você me deixou
Você me deixou, me deixou tão louca, baby
Hey!

And each time you kiss a girl
You never know what it's worth

Lost all your money to her
All I wanna know is if you love her
How come you never give in?

Eu costumava comandar a boca igual o Juan Pierre
Agora comando o baixo, o chimbal e a caixa
Eu pegava garotas como as bolsas Birkin
Agora pego a B (Menino, você tá abalando isso)
Brooklyn Bay, onde nasci
Agora tô em todo lugar, o nervo do rap
A audácia de me colocar com as curtinas abertas
Eu e a B, ela tá prestes a picar, se afaste

Dos seus olhos, sorrio, como se eu te respirasse

Sopra o vento, ele é tão Chicago

This ain't gon' be easy
Uh
You got it? You got it?
Put it in

[Verse 1]
Tables turnin' to a situation
Now you standin' in my face and you been patiently waitin'
Fumblin' over words, forget the conversation
Thinkin' maybe we can make a combination
Wanna see me lose my breath and wanna hear me moan?
Better be ready, well and able when we get along
You was talkin' confident upon the telephone
So you gotta put it in when we get it on

[Pre-Chorus]
No turning back from this party
Put you through enough to come play (Hey!)
Ain't no coming down from this high
My love don't go nowhere 'less I say
Look at what you got yourself into
Best take advantage, be all that you can be
Best take advantage, see all that you can see
'Cause this could be your last opportunity to move me


[Chorus]
(Put it in!)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work!)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it

Don't come around if you gon' let me down
You gotta get it all the way in
I wanna see you work

[Verse 2]
Now you lookin' like you lookin' for an explanation
Use the curves in my body for your motivation
Skip the petty games, no need for complications
Use both hands to make sure I reach my destination
You better leave a good impression 'fore you hit the dough
'Cause you don't want me talkin' 'bout your business on the low
If you show it off, I had to fit you in my schedule
So you better put it on me when it's time to go!


[Pre-Chorus]
No turning back from this party
Put you through enough to come play (Hey!)
And ain't no coming down from this high
My love don't go nowhere 'less I say
Look at what you got yourself into
Best take advantage, be all that you can be
Best take advantage, see all that you can see
'Cause this could be your last opportunity to move me

Don't come around if you gon' let me down
You gotta get it all the way in
I wanna see you work


[Bridge]
I ain't acceptin' no excuses, baby (N-n-no)
To brag about it, it'd be useless, baby (N-n-no)
You better blow me away, make a girl want to stay
At your spot for another round
It's your chance to prove, don't forget your moves
There's nothing to lose, but me!

[Chorus]

Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it (Put it in, put it in, put it in)

Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it (Do, d-do it baby, get it babe)

Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it (Work it, work it baby, get it babe)
(Work!)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it (Check it, check it baby, get it babe)
(Go hard!)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it (Uh huh)

The moment is all that we have
My meter should be up by the half
A ticket is the least of my cares
So let me ask you, uh
Am I dreaming?
Mind on the tip of a cloud
Or is it real as the stone in your crown?
Say, ain't nobody towing my Jag, uh
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl, huh?
Your heart don't stand a chance
I'm waiting for the white flag
You're talking with the blunt in your hand
And won't you pass that, huh?
I know in the morning
The sunlight cover your wounds, huh
But I'm hoping that I look the same as the way you always knew
Baby, of course, I flew
But I'm not over what we had, huh
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl, uh?
Your heart don't stand a chance

Like any moment I might wake up
'Cause she's the only thing I think of
I told my mother that I love her


[Chorus]
She just said, ""Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now""
That's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I being immature? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
She's in my—
In my—

[Outro]
I said, ""We'll see, we'll see"" (In my—)
We'll see
Ah, we'll see
We'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
See how we go
Until we know what the future holds
Ah, we'll see
We'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see"

I was from the city, she was from the outside
I was from the North, she was from the South Side
I looked in the mirror, I said: ""Man, I'm alright""
Little did I know I'd be crying all night
'Cause I was from the city, she was from the outside
I was from the North, she was from the South Side
I looked in the mirror, I said: ""Man, I'm alright""
Little did I know I'd be crying all night
'Cause I was from the city

Tip that glass, spark that 'dro
Shake that ass, move that dope
Rappers sound like Dr. Seuss, but not as dope
Clench your teeth and bite my flow
These folk is bogus, y'all go home (Hahah)
Therapist said I should focus
I had reached the lowest lows
Hurt my sikee, y'all should know this
Do you care? You probably don't
Confidence had lowered to degree
I thought would never show
(And what you got?)
Got a couple months to get my act together
Get this shit up off my shoulders
I swear it's a heavy load


[Chorus]
I was from the city, she was from the outside
I was from the North, she was from the South Side
I looked in the mirror, I said: ""Man, I'm alright""
Little did I know I'd be crying all night
'Cause I was from the city, she was from the outside
I was from the North, she was from the South Side
I looked in the mirror, I said: ""Man, I'm alright""
Little did I know I'd be crying all night
'Cause I was from the city

Ain't no opponent, now where is the fun at?
No competition, the game, oh, we own that
I been to places and I'm in the zone at 351
Had been waiting for dope rap and I'm here now
Yeah, I been killing shit since '96
Make legend rappers my sidekicks
Tell record labels no mind tricks
I got co-signs, a whole line of it, let's get it

[Chorus]
I was from the city, she was from the outside
I was from the North, she was from the South Side
I looked in the mirror, I said: ""Man, I'm alright""
Little did I know I'd be crying all night
'Cause I was from the city, she was from the outside
I was from the North, she was from the South Side
I looked in the mirror, I said: ""Man, I'm alright""
Little did I know I'd be crying all night
'Cause I was from the city, she was from the outside
I was from the North, she was from the South Side
I looked in the mirror, I said: ""Man, I'm alright""

You can come to my hotel, you can bring me a friend
You can dress up like twins, I can teach you some French
Paper planes full of kush, a couple cups full of gin
Don't know what city I'm in, wake up and do it again
And if you know me well, then I don't like to talk
But when I make a move, you know it's loud as fuck

1739,Insatiable,Darren Hayes,"10 ContributorsInsatiable Lyrics[Verse 1]
When moonlight crawls along the street
Chasing away the summer heat
Footsteps outside somewhere below
The world revolves, I let it go
We build our church above this street
We practice love between these sheets
The candy sweetness scent of you
It bathes my skin, I'm stained in you
And all I have to do is hold you
There's a racing within my heart
And I am barely touching you

[Chorus]
Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you is
Insatiable
Turn me on
Never stop
Wanna taste every drop
My love for you is
Insatiable

[Verse 2]
The moonlight plays upon your skin
A kiss that lingers takes me in
I fall asleep inside of you
There are no words
There's only truth
Breathe in, breathe out
There is no sound
We move together up and down
We levitate, our bodies soar
Our feet don't even touch the floor
And nobody knows you like I do
Cause the world, they don't understand
But I grow stronger in your hands


[Chorus]
Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you is
Insatiable
Turn me on
Never stop
Wanna taste every drop
My love for you is

We never sleep, we're always holdin' hands
Kissin' for hours, talkin', makin' plans
I feel like a better man
Just being in the same room
We never sleep, there's just so much to do
So much to say
Can't close my eyes when I'm with you
Insatiable, the way I'm loving you

Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you is

I just passed that ""Nigga fell off"" stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now that word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be soundin' like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow
[Outro]
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, (I make) all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, (I make) all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, (I make) all of them swallow
All of, all of, all of them swallow

So I'll say that I'm tired and go then walk halfway home

Convince  myself that I believe what I wrote
They  said that I would find somebody to hold but you're all I know

Want  me to lie and tell you it's been easy
To watch you move on while I take care of these
Broken pieces where my heart should be

Why I'm not talking at the party, looking angry again

I don't have no fuckin' friends
I don't care, I'm not upset
I admit that I'm a mess
I don't have no fuckin' friends
Don't have fun, I don't make plans
I don't have no fuckin' friends

[Verse 1]
If less is more, then I'm doing the most
I'm so bored and I feel like a ghost
I don't wanna smoke
No more 'cause I'm broke
And my window won't open
God, my life is a joke

[Verse 2]
But then I wake up and I do it again
But then I'm livin' life and I don't have any friends
Like I said in the chorus
My life is so boring
And so unimportant
Guess I'll call my mom again, 'cause

I don't have no fuckin' friends
I don't care, I'm not upset

In the shadows he saw four eyes, lit by fire, fire
He'd never done that with a lover before, before
Meanwhile everyone else got lost in quiet, by the river
Seekin' for more, of course he found better

[Chorus]
He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the mood

[Verse 2]
In the shadows he saw four eyes, lit by fire, fire
He'd never done that with a lover before, before
He was seeking for more
Either early or too late, it was number seven and it happened
High like a bird with his beak through the window

[Chorus]
He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the mood
He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed

But imma take a risk, step into this big crowd

But I won't answer to anyone
If they gon' step, I'm sure they gon run
And if they swing left we gon still go up and
No more complaining, cause look we made this year
Can't you just face it?
We outta the basement, clear?
Pass me the surfboard, pass me the blimp
Pass me the Grammy, pass me the globe
Pass me the Oscar and then some more Grammy's, ight?

He misses you, he wants you, but
You just don't feel the same

She doesn't want him because he cares too much
But now he's gone and she's alone again
Maybe if she tried a little harder to find

I see the signs of a lifetime, you till I die
And I'm swiftly out, Irish goodbye

[Chorus]
What if it's not meant for me?
Love
What if it's not meant for me?
Love

[Verse 1]
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to take you out
We'd go to The Hail Mary
And afterwards make out
Instead, I'm typing you a message
That I know I'll never send
Rewriting old excuses
Delete the kisses at the end
When I see you, the whole world reduces
To just that room
And then I remember and I'm shy
That gossip's eye will look too soon
And then I'm trapped, overthinking
And yeah, probably self-doubt
You tell me to get over it
And to take you out
But I can't, I'm too scared
And here's the night bus, I have to go
And the doors are closing, and you were waving
And I like you, and I'll never let it show
And you won't wait, and maybe I won't mind
I work better on my own
And now I'm home, a little bit drunk
And I ask myself


[Chorus]
What if it's not meant for me?
Love
What if it's not meant for me?
Love

[Verse 2]
A few days pass since I last saw you
And you've taken over my mind
I'm retelling jokes you made that made me laugh
Pretending that they're mine
I wanna tell the whole world about you
I think that that's a sign
I'm losing self-control and it's you
It really is, one thousand times
I look at your picture and I smile
How awful's that? I'm like a teenage girl
I might as well write all over my notebook
That you ""rock my world""
But you do, you really do
You've turned me upside down
And that's okay, I'll let it happen
'Cause I like having you around
I'm electric, a romantic cliché
Yeah, they really are all true
When we catch eyes at that stupid party
I know exactly what to do
I'll take your hand, and we will leave
French exits from me and you
And now I'm home, a little bit drunk
Some things don't change
And I know now


[Chorus]
Me and you were meant to be
In love
Me and you were meant to be
In love
Me and you

Cuando él me llama, me vuelvo loca
Me llama con mis amigas, no me desfasa
Ventanas bajadas, manejando en el SUV
Y ando salpicando champán en toda mi pantalla, gritando
Las llantas se están chirriando, cientos de millas por hora
Él me ama porque soy salvaje, cámara del teléfono en el baño
Ring-rin, voy a dejar que suene
Suena muy bien, podría subirle fuerte

Sé que eres lo que estoy buscando y estoy muy cansada de desearlo
Podemos hacerlo ahora o más tarde, no hace la diferencia
Él me envió un mensaje de texto, dice ""Nos vemos cuando llegues aquí""
Estaba sola la semana pasada, pero no lo estaré el próximo año
Bésame en la mejilla izquierda, ámame como mi amiga
En el teléfono con Ashley, corre mierda como un atleta
Estaremos en el juego, sí, pero nunca los jugaremos
Él podría estar en peligro, yo todavía no lo salvaría
Estaré al frente como Rudolph el Reindeer
Puedo decirte que te enamoraste, esa es la razón por la que viniste aquí
No tienes que mentir, solo sé honesto contigo mismo
No estarías aquí si fuera por alguien más

Es solo el único que conozco, es solo el único que conozco

Y cuando él me llama no vuelvo a casa

Tiré mi teléfono, lo escondo en algún lugar que nadie conozca
Enterrado en el suelo, por lo que nunca se pueda encontrar

Fucking around, I'm falling in love
Saying goodbye 'cause you're giving it up
All that you were, all that you lost
Who ever thought it came with a cost?

[Verse 1]
We were alone, we were to blame
Alive with the same blood in our veins
I never thought to find a way here
Well, you can't plan for this one, it's nothing compared
To the fate of the thing searching forward to me
All the world to be seen as it's all passing by

[Chorus]
Fucking around, I'm falling in love
Saying goodbye 'cause you're giving it up
All that you were, all that you lost
Who ever thought it came with a cost?
I ran to you, I ran to you
I ran to you and you know why
I ran to you, I ran to you
I ran to you and you know why

[Post-Chorus]
Love the way you read my eyes
I love the way you read my eyes


[Verse 2]
To the fate of the thing searchin' forward to me
When it's finally seen all the love in your eyes
Well, I should've known it, how the world disappeared
When you came around, when you came around
When you came around
When you came around, you came around

[Chorus]
Fucking around, I'm falling in love
Saying goodbye 'cause you're giving it up
All that you were, all that you lost
Who ever thought it came with a cost?
I ran to you, I ran to you
I ran to you and you know why
I ran to you, I ran to you
I ran to you and you know why

Never took your side, never cursed your name
I keep my lips shut tight, until you go-o-o-oh

Until you realise, that you should go-o-o-oh

Will never keep our cold heart from calling

And I will cover you, until you go-o-o-oh

And keep a prize with me, until you go-o-o-oh

Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens

Biting the shit out of her straw
Ready to go out, only her body tells her no
Pretty but sad inside, isn't she beautiful?
Queen of the ball even when she's home alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And she said
I'm not here for love tonight
The way you touch just don't feel right
Used to feelin' things so cold
Minimizin' windows
Pictures lit by electric lights
Fiction, fact, boundaries collide
Find me in my palm so bright

Came here on my own, party on my phone
Came here on my own but I start to feel alone
Better late than never, so I'll be alright
Happiest whenever I'm with you online

Better together
Ever the overrated touch
I am connected, I am the girl you want to watch
Lips full of glitter glow, spinnin' like mirror-balls
Phone in a strobe, stuck in a crazy cyber-world

Free to roam all over my cyber fantasy
Better late than never but I am alright
Happiest whenever I'm with you online

'Cross the distant galaxy

Wait a minute
I think I left my conscience on your front doorstep, woah, woah
Wait a minute
I think I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
But I'm here right now, right now
(Right now, right now)
Just sitting in a cloud, oh wow
I'm here right now, right now with you, oh wow, oh wow
(Right now, with you)
I don't even care
I’ll run my hands through your hair
You wanna run your fingers through mine
But my dreads too thick and that's alright

Hold on, wait a minute
Feel my heart's intention, oh
Hold on, wait a minute

Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh

Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
You left your diary at my house
And I read those pages, do you really love me, baby?
Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
But I broke my word, and you were bound to see
And I cried at the curb
When you first said, ""Oel ngati kameie""

Hold on, wait a minute (Oh)
Feel my heart's intention
Hold on, wait a minute

Left my soul in his vision

Some just tryin' to get by
Some people like that hurt
Some just rather say goodbye, bye
